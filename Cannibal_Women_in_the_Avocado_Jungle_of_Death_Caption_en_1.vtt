00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:25.442 line:-2
(frogs croaking)

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:33.950 line:-1
(orchestral music)

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.540 line:-2
(dramatic music) (birds chirping)

00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:08.086 line:-2
- We're lost.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.214 line:-1
- No we're not.

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:12.173 line:-1
Look!

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.299 line:-2
Over there!

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:31.609 line:-1
- Sam.

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:32.444 line:-1
- Yeah?

00:02:32.527 --> 00:02:34.237 line:-2
- I think we should head back. We're getting in too deep.

00:02:34.362 --> 00:02:35.697 line:-1
- Aw but...

00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:37.240 line:-1
Wait a second.

00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:38.241 line:-1
What's that I hear?

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:39.200 line:-1
(women laughing)

00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:40.827 line:-1
Sounds like.

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:42.412 line:-1
Women.

00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:44.039 line:-2
Laughing. - Let's get out of here.

00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:46.249 line:-2
- Come on man, don't be such a coward.

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:47.792 line:-1
Let's check this out.

00:03:09.397 --> 00:03:11.107 line:-1
Look at them.

00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:12.317 line:-1
They're beautiful.

00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:15.612 line:-2
Aren't they the most lovely, sensuous,

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:17.781 line:-2
inviting women you've ever seen?

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:19.449 line:-2
- Let's get out of here. - What are you, nuts?

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:20.325 line:-2
Look at them!

00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:24.371 line:-1
- They're dangerous.

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:26.456 line:-1
- They don't look dangerous.

00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:27.582 line:-1
They look lonely.

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:30.502 line:-2
- I'm getting out of here.

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.129 line:-2
- Yeah, well I'm gonna go introduce myself.

00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:34.255 line:-1
Yoohoo!

00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:35.632 line:-1
Ladies!

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:36.549 line:-1
Ladies!

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:57.362 line:-1
(suspense music)

00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:34.482 line:-2
- Ahh!

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:45.452 line:-2
- Hello. - Hi.

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:46.369 line:-2
Hi girls.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.371 line:-1
Peace, peace.

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:50.707 line:-1
Peace.

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:52.292 line:-1
Friends?

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:53.501 line:-2
Come on, guys.

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:56.421 line:-1
I just wanted an avocado.

00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:03.345 line:-2
- Throughout history, the dominant sex

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:04.512 line:-2
would subjugate the weaker.

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:06.556 line:-2
Just as the Chinese bound the feet of young girls

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:08.892 line:-2
to cripple them into helplessness,

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:11.436 line:-2
so did the Amazon women break the legs

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:13.813 line:-2
of boys to make them subservient.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.692 line:-3
Is it possible for men and women to coexist as equals?

00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:19.361 line:-1
(bell rings)

00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:22.197 line:-2
That's a subject we'll tackle in our next class.

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:31.915 line:-2
- Dr. Hunt, I really love your class.

00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:32.832 line:-2
- Well thank you, Bunny.

00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:33.792 line:-2
You can call me Margo.

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.377 line:-2
- I like it so much I've been thinking about

00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:36.920 line:-2
changing my major from Home Economics

00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:38.838 line:-2
to Feminist Studies, but I wasn't sure

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:40.924 line:-2
if you had any feminist cooking classes.

00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:44.260 line:-2
- I don't think we do, no.

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:45.470 line:-1
Interesting thought though.

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:52.394 line:-3
- I mean the idea of being socially conditioned

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.895 line:-2
to be a sex object, wait until

00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:55.438 line:-2
I tell the girls at the sorority.

00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:56.648 line:-2
- Bunny, I think you should take

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:58.441 line:-2
a few more classes in Women's Studies

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:00.485 line:-2
before you decide to switch majors.

00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:02.320 line:-3
- But Dr. Hunt, I know I wanna be a liberated girl.

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:04.447 line:-3
I can just feel it in my toes.

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:06.366 line:-2
- It could be those pointy boots.

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:07.492 line:-1
- Margo.

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:08.410 line:-1
- Dean Stockwell.

00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:09.577 line:-3
- Dr. Hunt, these gentlemen from

00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:12.288 line:-3
the United States government would like to talk to you.

00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:13.289 line:-2
This is Mr. Ford Maddox,

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:16.042 line:-3
US Department of Agriculture, and Colonel Mattel,

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:19.295 line:-3
National Security Commission of Avocado Affairs.

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:20.463 line:-2
- Avocado Affairs?

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.507 line:-3
- Miss Hunt, this is a matter of national importance.

00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:23.967 line:-2
We need to speak to you immediately.

00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:24.884 line:-1
- Alone.

00:06:26.678 --> 00:06:28.972 line:-2
- Dr. Hunt, 98% of the avocados produced

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:32.308 line:-3
in the United States come from the state of California.

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:35.603 line:-3
Most of these come from a jungle area that spreads

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.689 line:-2
from Bakersfield to the Mexican border.

00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:40.316 line:-1
The Avocado Belt.

00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:41.484 line:-1
- I'm aware of that.

00:06:41.609 --> 00:06:42.902 line:-3
What does it have to do with me?

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.321 line:-2
- Miss Hunt, maybe you don't get the point.

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:48.950 line:-3
Avocados are vital to this nation's security interests.

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:51.494 line:-3
The Communists are already in control of Nicaragua

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:54.456 line:-3
and Guatemala and El Salvador are strife with revolution.

00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:56.374 line:-2
California's the last secure supply

00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:58.501 line:-2
of avocados in the free world.

00:06:58.626 --> 00:06:59.836 line:-1
We're on the verge of a major

00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:02.589 line:-2
avocado gap with the Soviet Union.

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:04.007 line:-1
Back in the Kremlin Gorbachev

00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:06.301 line:-2
is just chuckling over his taquitos.

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:09.012 line:-2
- I still don't see what that has to do with me.

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:11.639 line:-2
- Doctor, have you ever taken a loyalty oath?

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:14.517 line:-2
- Colonel, let me handle this.

00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:16.478 line:-2
As I was saying, most of the avocados

00:07:16.644 --> 00:07:19.105 line:-3
from the United States come from The Avocado Belt,

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:22.567 line:-3
but they are harvested only on the perimeter of the jungle.

00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:25.028 line:-2
Because as we all know, the interior

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:27.572 line:-2
is completely wild and uncharted.

00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:30.700 line:-2
Anyone that strays too close to the heart

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:32.869 line:-2
of The Avocado Jungle never returns.

00:07:33.036 --> 00:07:33.787 line:-1
- Why?

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:36.623 line:-2
- That's a very good question, Bunny.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.708 line:-2
(Bunny giggles)

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:40.835 line:-3
Perhaps Dr. Hunt would like to answer it.

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:43.588 line:-1
(dramatic music)

00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:46.633 line:-2
- It's only a legend really.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.593 line:-2
- We're convinced that they're real.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.678 line:-1
- Who?

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:52.555 line:-1
- The Piranha Women.

00:07:52.681 --> 00:07:53.556 line:-1
- Piranha Women?

00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:54.474 line:-1
Who are they?

00:07:55.517 --> 00:07:58.853 line:-3
- They're an ancient commune of feminists.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.481 line:-2
So radical, so militant.

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:05.819 line:-2
So left -centered they eat their men.

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:07.070 line:-1
- Oh that.

00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:08.571 line:-2
Well if I like a guy I usually start at-

00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:10.740 line:-2
- They don't eat their men like that, Bunny.

00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:12.492 line:-2
More like a black widow spider.

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:14.953 line:-2
They have sex with their men and they kill them.

00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:18.832 line:-2
Then they tear them into strips

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:21.376 line:-2
like beef jerky and eat them with guacamole.

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:23.586 line:-1
So legend has it.

00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:24.879 line:-2
- They are more than a legend,

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:27.507 line:-2
they're a major agricultural problem.

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:29.926 line:-2
It used to be safe for avocado pickers

00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:32.971 line:-2
to venture within 20 miles of the jungle's edge.

00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:35.098 line:-3
But lately the Piranha Women have broadened their hold.

00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:38.226 line:-2
No one is safe anywhere in The Avocado Belt.

00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:39.519 line:-3
- Well if they're that much trouble why don't you

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:41.730 line:-2
just send in the troops and round them up?

00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:42.647 line:-1
- Colonel Mattel?

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:45.150 line:-1
- Fact is we tried.

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:47.485 line:-2
We sent in three divisions armored

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:49.988 line:-2
with air support, the best men we have.

00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:51.072 line:-1
- And?

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:52.073 line:-1
- They got whooped.

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:54.534 line:-2
- They didn't play fair.

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:57.620 line:-3
Our men are trained for state of the art high tech warfare.

00:08:57.746 --> 00:09:01.958 line:-3
These Piranha Women were using knives and spears.

00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:04.044 line:-2
Officers got confused and they...

00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:08.590 line:-3
We found these at the edge of the jungle.

00:09:10.091 --> 00:09:10.842 line:-1
- Dog tags?

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:11.968 line:-1
- Look closely.

00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:14.804 line:-2
They're covered with guacamole dip.

00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:16.639 line:-2
- Ew. - Ew.

00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:18.558 line:-2
- Now do you get my point, Doctor?

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:19.809 line:-2
Your sisters in the jungle

00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:21.811 line:-2
are eating the few and the proud!

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:23.480 line:-2
- Control yourself, Colonel.

00:09:24.606 --> 00:09:27.525 line:-3
Look, naturally we would prefer a military solution.

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:29.235 line:-3
But frankly the US military hasn't had

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:31.946 line:-3
a lot of luck in jungle warfare lately.

00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:34.783 line:-3
So we're forced to negotiate with the Piranha Women.

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:36.701 line:-2
That's where you come in.

00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:40.663 line:-3
We want you to go into the jungle

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.833 line:-3
and try to reason with these man -eaters.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.835 line:-1
- I can't do that, Mr. Maddox.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.671 line:-1
- We just want the Piranha Women

00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:50.006 line:-1
to move out of The Avocado Jungle.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.218 line:-1
To a reservation in Malibu.

00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:58.556 line:-1
Deluxe condominiums.

00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:02.227 line:-1
Pool, sauna, ample parking.

00:10:02.394 --> 00:10:03.353 line:-1
Total luxury living.

00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:05.814 line:-3
We are even willing, at the government's expense,

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.608 line:-3
to convert the exercise room so that they

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:11.820 line:-2
may maintain their bizarre sacrificial rituals.

00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:13.279 line:-1
Let me come to the point.

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:16.533 line:-2
We don't care if these girls wanna eat their men.

00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:18.076 line:-1
That's the Piranha Man's problem.

00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:22.747 line:-2
We just want the avocados.

00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:27.544 line:-2
We're willing to pay for them.

00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:29.254 line:-3
- I'm sorry, the answer's still no.

00:10:33.717 --> 00:10:35.844 line:-2
- Just like you girls to stick together.

00:10:36.011 --> 00:10:37.679 line:-3
Why don't you tell us the real reason

00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:39.764 line:-3
you're not gonna go into that jungle!

00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:40.974 line:-3
You'd like to see the United States

00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:43.893 line:-3
humiliated by a communist avocado yield!

00:10:44.019 --> 00:10:45.228 line:-3
I think you'd like to eat me

00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:47.022 line:-2
right now wouldn't you, Doctor Hunt?

00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:48.314 line:-3
- Dr. Hunt wouldn't eat anybody.

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:49.733 line:-3
- Colonel, control yourself!

00:10:53.737 --> 00:10:55.989 line:-3
Dr. Hunt is a respected middle of the road feminist.

00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:00.744 line:-3
And I'm sure she'll be happy to cooperate with us,

00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:03.830 line:-3
especially when she considers how much this university

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:06.541 line:-2
depends upon grants from the defense department.

00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:09.085 line:-3
For its space weaponry program.

00:11:11.171 --> 00:11:14.132 line:-3
And if Miss Hunt, Dr. Hunt, is still unable

00:11:14.299 --> 00:11:18.011 line:-3
to see the logic in insisting us, why I'm sure

00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:20.680 line:-3
Dean Stockwell will explain it to her.

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:21.848 line:-2
Won't you, Dean?

00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:25.810 line:-3
- Now now now gentlemen.

00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:30.774 line:-3
I will not tolerate tactics of this kind.

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:32.942 line:-3
This university is a bastion of intellectual freedom

00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:34.986 line:-3
and I am sworn to protect that freedom.

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:37.906 line:-1
I will not tolerate my professors

00:11:38.073 --> 00:11:40.825 line:-3
being coerced into anything against their will.

00:11:40.992 --> 00:11:43.244 line:-2
No matter how much political pressure

00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:44.829 line:-3
is put on me personally.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.252 line:-3
Margo you will do exactly as they tell you

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:52.671 line:-3
or I will cut your funding off

00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:54.381 line:-3
and you can kiss your tenure goodbye.

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:55.632 line:-1
Comprehendo?

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:56.549 line:-2
- Mmmhm.

00:11:57.801 --> 00:11:59.344 line:-3
- The real question here is whether or not

00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:03.348 line:-3
this project is worthy of Spritzer College's involvement.

00:12:03.515 --> 00:12:04.599 line:-3
What do you say, doc?

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:07.894 line:-3
- Guess I'm going in the jungle.

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:09.646 line:-2
- Terrific. Nice seeing you.

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:10.689 line:-2
- Thanks again for your help, Dean.

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:12.065 line:-1
- Oh any time.

00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:13.149 line:-2
- Mr. Maddox.

00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:16.820 line:-3
There's something you're not telling me.

00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:18.321 line:-3
- Why? What do you mean?

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:19.781 line:-3
- You don't expect me to believe

00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:20.740 line:-3
I'm the first feminist you've sent in

00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:22.909 line:-3
to try and reason with the Piranha Women.

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:24.786 line:-3
What's really going on in that jungle?

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:27.831 line:-3
- I suppose you have the right to know the truth.

00:12:27.956 --> 00:12:29.874 line:-3
Two years ago we sent into The Avocado Jungle

00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:31.292 line:-3
a leading feminist scholar.

00:12:32.377 --> 00:12:33.253 line:-2
Dr. Kurtz.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.838 line:-2
- Dr. Kurtz?

00:12:35.005 --> 00:12:36.339 line:-1
Internationally famous author

00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:39.884 line:-3
of Smart Women, Stupid Insensitive Men?

00:12:40.051 --> 00:12:41.094 line:-2
- Yes.

00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:42.887 line:-3
- That explains her sudden disappearance

00:12:43.054 --> 00:12:44.222 line:-3
from the talk show circuit.

00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:46.683 line:-3
What happened to her?

00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:48.018 line:-2
- We really don't know.

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:49.269 line:-3
She may have been killed or perhaps

00:12:49.436 --> 00:12:51.104 line:-3
they're holding her prisoner.

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:52.439 line:-2
It was shortly after her expedition

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:54.733 line:-2
that the Piranha Women went on a rampage.

00:12:56.443 --> 00:13:00.822 line:-3
Well I guess now that you know, you refuse to go.

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:03.908 line:-2
- Quite the contrary.

00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:05.827 line:-2
Now I know I must go.

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:10.165 line:-2
No Bunny, you can't come.

00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:12.042 line:-2
- Doctor Hunt, why can't I go with you?

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:13.710 line:-1
- Bunny.

00:13:13.835 --> 00:13:16.212 line:-3
Look, nobody's ever returned from The Avocado Jungle.

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:18.798 line:-3
There'll be countless dangers and perils along the way.

00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:21.217 line:-3
I can't take a sophomore into the wilderness.

00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:23.011 line:-3
You don't have the skills or training.

00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:24.054 line:-3
And besides, you haven't even finished

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.889 line:-2
your general ed requirements.

00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:28.099 line:-3
Now I'm sorry Bunny, it's just too dangerous.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.936 line:-1
- Bunny baby!

00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:34.481 line:-3
Hey good looking, how you doing?

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:35.398 line:-1
- Hi Chucky.

00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:36.316 line:-1
- Hi.

00:13:36.441 --> 00:13:38.526 line:-3
Bunny, babe, the super party boys

00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:40.028 line:-3
at the Delta Epsilon are having

00:13:40.195 --> 00:13:42.530 line:-3
another super party this Friday night.

00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:44.783 line:-3
You're not doing anything are you?

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:47.410 line:-3
- Well I wanted to do something, but I guess I'm not.

00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:48.703 line:-1
- Great!

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:51.414 line:-3
Great, look, this is gonna be a toga party and a beer bust.

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:54.793 line:-3
And for special girls like you, we are going

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:56.920 line:-3
to be having a wet t-shirt contest.

00:13:57.087 --> 00:13:59.005 line:-3
- But all my t -shirts are dry.

00:13:59.172 --> 00:14:01.466 line:-2
(Chucky laughs)

00:14:01.633 --> 00:14:03.134 line:-3
- Bunny, don't worry about that.

00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:05.845 line:-3
The fraternity brothers, we're gonna take care of you.

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:07.972 line:-3
Bun, you ever do any mud wrestling?

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.017 line:-3
- I... - You're coming with me.

00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:11.935 line:-3
- I get to go?

00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:13.395 line:-3
- You'd be safer in the jungle!

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:14.896 line:-2
- Bye Chucky!

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.440 line:-3
- Patricia, have those filing cabinets

00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:18.775 line:-3
I ordered come in yet?

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.026 line:-2
- No.

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:21.277 line:-3
I've had them on back order for two weeks.

00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:23.405 line:-3
- Hmm, never mind.

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:24.823 line:-3
I'm going to do some field research

00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:26.408 line:-3
and I need some supplies.

00:14:26.574 --> 00:14:29.077 line:-3
Okay, three legal-sized pads.

00:14:30.412 --> 00:14:32.080 line:-2
10 manila envelopes.

00:14:33.665 --> 00:14:34.958 line:-1
Dictaphone recorder.

00:14:35.959 --> 00:14:38.378 line:-3
And four one hour tapes.

00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:40.880 line:-3
I'll need a Bowie knife, first aid kit.

00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:43.758 line:-3
100 feet of nylon mountain climbing rope.

00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:46.928 line:-3
A breech -loading revolver and holster.

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:51.224 line:-3
A thousand rounds of ammunition.

00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:54.811 line:-3
- Full metal jacket, hollow point, or Teflon -coated?

00:14:54.978 --> 00:14:56.312 line:-3
- Which do you think would be best for fighting

00:14:56.479 --> 00:14:59.441 line:-3
the dangers that lurk inside a hostile jungle environment?

00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:00.900 line:-3
- I would alternate hollow

00:15:01.067 --> 00:15:03.319 line:-3
and Teflon bullets in the chamber.

00:15:03.486 --> 00:15:06.448 line:-3
That way you have maximum stopping power,

00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:09.075 line:-3
but still armor -piercing capability.

00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:17.167 line:-2
- Dr. Hunt!

00:15:17.292 --> 00:15:18.043 line:-1
Yoohoo!

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:21.046 line:-1
Yoohoo!

00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:22.464 line:-2
I'm ready!

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:23.882 line:-2
- Oh Bunny.

00:15:24.049 --> 00:15:24.799 line:-3
Don't you think you could've worn

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:26.176 line:-2
something a little more practical?

00:15:26.301 --> 00:15:27.302 line:-3
We're going into uncharted jungle.

00:15:27.469 --> 00:15:30.013 line:-3
- Well I do have a pair of flats in my suitcase.

00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:34.059 line:-3
- Well never mind.

00:15:34.225 --> 00:15:35.393 line:-3
If you get in trouble you can wear something of mine.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.311 line:-2
- Oh good.

00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:43.276 line:-3
And I brought along some great lingerie we can share.

00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:50.408 line:-1
(orchestral music)

00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:14.349 line:-3
Why do the Piranha Women eat their men?

00:16:14.516 --> 00:16:17.060 line:-3
- Well primitive cultures often use overly simplistic

00:16:17.227 --> 00:16:20.230 line:-2
methods of dealing with inter-tribal conflicts.

00:16:20.355 --> 00:16:22.941 line:-3
the Piranha Women probably figured that the problems

00:16:23.108 --> 00:16:25.026 line:-3
that arise between men and women naturally in any

00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:27.862 line:-3
relationship were best solved by ritualized killing.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.158 line:-3
- Do a lot of feminists eat men?

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:33.159 line:-2
- No, Bunny.

00:16:34.536 --> 00:16:36.121 line:-2
Not many.

00:16:36.287 --> 00:16:37.205 line:-3
You have to understand that

00:16:37.372 --> 00:16:40.000 line:-2
the Piranha Women are a primitive, ancient,

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:42.085 line:-3
radical offshoot of the women's movement.

00:16:42.252 --> 00:16:44.546 line:-3
Now most feminists like myself and Dr. Kurtz,

00:16:44.713 --> 00:16:46.506 line:-3
we believe in equality between the sexes,

00:16:46.673 --> 00:16:49.050 line:-2
not the domination of women over men.

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:50.593 line:-2
And there aren't any modern feminists

00:16:50.719 --> 00:16:52.178 line:-3
that advocate cannibalism.

00:16:53.304 --> 00:16:54.472 line:-3
At least not since the 60s.

00:16:56.558 --> 00:16:59.352 line:-1
(orchestral music)

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.368 line:-2
San Bernardino.

00:17:15.535 --> 00:17:17.120 line:-3
A rough speck of civilization

00:17:17.245 --> 00:17:18.997 line:-3
on the edge of The Avocado Belt.

00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:21.499 line:-3
We'll head down to some local establishments

00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:22.667 line:-3
and see if we can find a mercenary

00:17:22.834 --> 00:17:24.711 line:-3
to guide us through the jungle.

00:17:24.878 --> 00:17:27.130 line:-3
- I've never been to San Bernardino before.

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:29.299 line:-3
- Don't worry, Bunny.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.552 line:-3
We'll be all right.

00:17:35.263 --> 00:17:38.224 line:-1
(orchestral music)

00:18:06.336 --> 00:18:07.128 line:-2
- Hey chickies.

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:09.130 line:-3
Can I buy you a drink?

00:18:09.297 --> 00:18:10.298 line:-2
- No thanks.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.135 line:-3
- When I offer a chick a drink I-

00:18:14.302 --> 00:18:15.428 line:-3
- I am not a chick.

00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:17.180 line:-3
I'm an ethnohistorian with a doctorate

00:18:17.305 --> 00:18:18.431 line:-2
in cultural anthropology.

00:18:18.598 --> 00:18:19.683 line:-2
Got that?

00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:20.600 line:-2
- Yes Doctor.

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:22.018 line:-2
- Good.

00:18:22.185 --> 00:18:23.103 line:-3
Now I understand that your compulsion

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:25.146 line:-3
to assault women verbally stems from a constant

00:18:25.313 --> 00:18:27.148 line:-3
exposure to violent and sexist images

00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:29.067 line:-3
from a male -dominated media.

00:18:29.234 --> 00:18:32.237 line:-3
Therefore, I won't blow a hole in your head.

00:18:32.404 --> 00:18:33.154 line:-3
- Thank you.

00:18:46.376 --> 00:18:48.086 line:-3
- I'm from the Department of Feminist Studies

00:18:48.253 --> 00:18:49.212 line:-3
at Spritzer College.

00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:53.758 line:-3
I wanna hire a mercenary for a very dangerous job.

00:18:56.386 --> 00:18:58.596 line:-2
(Anvil roars)

00:18:59.514 --> 00:19:00.265 line:-2
- I'm Anvil.

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:04.102 line:-3
A crazy ex -Vietnam vet who hires

00:19:04.269 --> 00:19:06.312 line:-2
himself out to the highest bidder.

00:19:08.398 --> 00:19:10.525 line:-3
I can rape, pillage.

00:19:10.692 --> 00:19:11.818 line:-2
(Anvil chuckles)

00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:15.363 line:-3
And napalm an entire South Asian village single -handedly.

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:22.746 line:-2
(Bunny coughs)

00:19:25.373 --> 00:19:26.541 line:-2
- I am Bushido.

00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:28.335 line:-3
The world's greatest ninja.

00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:29.586 line:-3
I am a killing machine.

00:19:29.711 --> 00:19:31.755 line:-3
Master of all the deadly arts.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.424 line:-3
And if you need a mercenary to kill and to maim.

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:36.593 line:-3
I am the best.

00:19:52.567 --> 00:19:55.278 line:-3
- I am the Black -Masked Avenger!

00:19:55.445 --> 00:20:00.325 line:-2
World champion wrestler and weightlifter!

00:20:01.493 --> 00:20:03.244 line:-3
I don't need no weapons or guns!

00:20:03.411 --> 00:20:07.374 line:-3
I can crush men with my bare hands!

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:08.875 line:-3
I can squish them!

00:20:09.042 --> 00:20:10.335 line:-2
Smash them!

00:20:10.502 --> 00:20:11.670 line:-3
And throttle them!

00:20:12.879 --> 00:20:15.382 line:-3
Look at this!

00:20:15.548 --> 00:20:18.259 line:-2
(Avenger screams)

00:20:30.355 --> 00:20:32.232 line:-3
So what is your job?

00:20:33.692 --> 00:20:36.319 line:-3
- You wanna burn down a small town?

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.447 line:-3
- Attack an impenetrable fortress?

00:20:39.614 --> 00:20:41.908 line:-3
- Or crush an army of enemies?

00:20:42.075 --> 00:20:44.661 line:-3
- I need a guide to take me through The Avocado Jungle.

00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:47.747 line:-3
- [Mercenaries] The Avocado Jungle?

00:20:47.914 --> 00:20:50.250 line:-2
- I want to make contact with the Piranha Women.

00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:53.294 line:-3
- [Mercenaries] The Piranha Women?

00:20:55.296 --> 00:20:59.384 line:-3
- Excuse me miss, I gotta go to the Veterans' Center.

00:20:59.551 --> 00:21:00.301 line:-2
For some counseling.

00:21:00.427 --> 00:21:01.219 line:-3
Maybe next time.

00:21:03.013 --> 00:21:04.347 line:-3
- I forgot, I'm busy.

00:21:04.514 --> 00:21:05.598 line:-3
They're a showing of Seven Samurai

00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:07.517 line:-3
tonight at The Nuart and...

00:21:07.642 --> 00:21:08.393 line:-1
Bye.

00:21:10.854 --> 00:21:12.772 line:-2
- I've gotta go on the Nutrisystem, yeah.

00:21:12.939 --> 00:21:14.357 line:-3
Lose a little weight.

00:21:14.524 --> 00:21:17.569 line:-3
A jungle trip is out of the question right now.

00:21:18.653 --> 00:21:20.405 line:-3
- Well let that be a lesson to you, Bunny.

00:21:20.572 --> 00:21:22.365 line:-2
A bunch of violent brutes wrapped up

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:24.576 line:-3
in a blanket of male machismo.

00:21:24.743 --> 00:21:25.952 line:-3
They're happy to victimize the helpless,

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:28.413 line:-3
but one thing sends them scurrying away.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.957 line:-3
One thing strips their phony courage.

00:21:31.124 --> 00:21:33.335 line:-3
The threat of a strong woman.

00:21:33.501 --> 00:21:36.212 line:-3
- Not so fast, Dr. Margo Hunt.

00:21:36.379 --> 00:21:38.548 line:-2
Ms. Ethnohistorian.

00:21:38.715 --> 00:21:41.551 line:-3
There's still some real men left in this world.

00:21:41.676 --> 00:21:42.719 line:-3
Men who haven't been castrated

00:21:42.886 --> 00:21:44.721 line:-3
by the years of feminist propaganda

00:21:44.888 --> 00:21:46.473 line:-3
that corrupted the public school system

00:21:46.639 --> 00:21:48.850 line:-2
and infected prime time television.

00:21:49.017 --> 00:21:51.895 line:-3
Men who believe that nature designed women to cook,

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:55.023 line:-3
nurture children, and pose for Penthouse magazine.

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:58.777 line:-3
Real men who say our role in this world is to love,

00:21:58.943 --> 00:22:02.405 line:-2
protect, and yes, I'm not afraid to say it.

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:03.448 line:-1
Dominate women.

00:22:09.871 --> 00:22:12.290 line:-3
I'll go into The Avocado Jungle with you.

00:22:12.457 --> 00:22:14.417 line:-3
I'll lead you to the Piranha Women.

00:22:14.584 --> 00:22:16.544 line:-3
I'm man enough to face the dangers that lurk

00:22:16.711 --> 00:22:18.421 line:-3
in the dark bosom of the jungle.

00:22:19.881 --> 00:22:21.383 line:-1
Ahh!

00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:22.425 line:-1
Rawr!

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:24.010 line:-1
Argh!

00:22:24.177 --> 00:22:24.928 line:-1
Ow!

00:22:34.187 --> 00:22:35.814 line:-3
I'm not afraid of the Piranha Women.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:40.568 line:-3
Any more than I'm afraid of a certain ethnohistorian who,

00:22:40.735 --> 00:22:44.406 line:-3
terrified of her own frailty and need to be loved,

00:22:44.572 --> 00:22:46.449 line:-3
abandoned her femineity in a bizarre

00:22:46.574 --> 00:22:49.452 line:-3
charade of scholarship and androgyny.

00:22:49.577 --> 00:22:50.620 line:-3
- Jim, what are you doing here?

00:22:50.787 --> 00:22:53.331 line:-3
- You know him, Dr. Hunt?

00:22:53.498 --> 00:22:55.291 line:-3
- Sure she knows me, Bunny.

00:22:55.417 --> 00:22:58.294 line:-3
Dr. Hunt and I are old friends aren't we, Margo?

00:22:58.461 --> 00:23:00.880 line:-3
- Well... - We were in love once.

00:23:01.047 --> 00:23:03.341 line:-3
Desperately and passionately in love.

00:23:04.509 --> 00:23:06.553 line:-3
But that was a long time ago wasn't it, Margo?

00:23:07.429 --> 00:23:08.680 line:-3
Back when your mind wasn't filled

00:23:08.847 --> 00:23:10.473 line:-2
with bizarre feminist notions

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.684 line:-3
about the meaninglessness of love.

00:23:12.851 --> 00:23:14.352 line:-2
Back then you were the most giving,

00:23:14.519 --> 00:23:16.312 line:-3
passionate woman I'd ever met in my life.

00:23:16.479 --> 00:23:19.691 line:-3
I turned my whole world upside down for you.

00:23:19.858 --> 00:23:22.485 line:-3
We shared our innermost thoughts and feelings.

00:23:22.652 --> 00:23:24.404 line:-2
We made plans, big plans.

00:23:24.571 --> 00:23:25.947 line:-2
Plans for a life together.

00:23:27.115 --> 00:23:29.325 line:-3
And then you dumped me flat because I didn't

00:23:29.451 --> 00:23:30.952 line:-3
turn out to be the sort of man who fit in

00:23:31.119 --> 00:23:31.995 line:-3
neatly with the feminist tommyrot

00:23:32.162 --> 00:23:35.373 line:-3
you were being force -fed by your professors.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:36.499 line:-2
- It was a one night stand.

00:23:36.624 --> 00:23:38.835 line:-3
I was half drunk and left right after we had sex.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.420 line:-3
We didn't say eight words to each other

00:23:40.587 --> 00:23:42.589 line:-2
and all yours were composed of one syllable.

00:23:42.756 --> 00:23:43.590 line:-1
- Ha!

00:23:43.757 --> 00:23:46.009 line:-3
Just like you to count the words, Dr. Hunt.

00:23:46.134 --> 00:23:47.052 line:-3
But what you never understood is there are

00:23:47.218 --> 00:23:49.512 line:-3
some feelings that can't be measured in words.

00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:51.598 line:-2
Some moments that last an eternity.

00:23:51.765 --> 00:23:53.016 line:-2
You toyed with my affections and after

00:23:53.141 --> 00:23:54.017 line:-3
you crushed my heart I crawled into

00:23:54.184 --> 00:23:56.811 line:-3
a whiskey bottle and I haven't come out since.

00:23:56.978 --> 00:23:58.521 line:-3
- You left for Hawaii the next day

00:23:58.688 --> 00:24:00.398 line:-2
with the bimbo in the cafeteria.

00:24:03.151 --> 00:24:06.988 line:-3
- Well, yeah, but I had made that date a week before.

00:24:07.155 --> 00:24:10.825 line:-3
And besides, the second I got back from Hawaii I crawled

00:24:10.992 --> 00:24:12.994 line:-3
into a whiskey bottle and I haven't come out since.

00:24:13.161 --> 00:24:14.996 line:-2
- Ugh, let's go, Bunny.

00:24:15.163 --> 00:24:16.373 line:-1
- Wait!

00:24:16.539 --> 00:24:17.624 line:-3
You said you needed a guide.

00:24:17.791 --> 00:24:19.084 line:-3
Well I'm the best.

00:24:20.794 --> 00:24:22.420 line:-3
- Well I've changed my mind.

00:24:22.587 --> 00:24:24.381 line:-2
- We'll do without one. - Fat chance.

00:24:24.506 --> 00:24:27.550 line:-3
You won't last 10 minutes in that jungle without me.

00:24:27.717 --> 00:24:29.094 line:-1
- I can take care of myself.

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.388 line:-2
- Not in The Avocado Jungle you can't.

00:24:31.554 --> 00:24:33.098 line:-2
Do you know what jungle herb cures

00:24:33.264 --> 00:24:35.517 line:-2
the poisonous bite of the river snake?

00:24:35.684 --> 00:24:36.434 line:-3
Do you know where the only land route is

00:24:36.518 --> 00:24:37.894 line:-2
around the white waters of death?

00:24:38.061 --> 00:24:39.521 line:-3
Do you know the way through the secret maze caves

00:24:39.688 --> 00:24:41.564 line:-2
that lie underneath Hangman's Cliff?

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:42.440 line:-1
Huh?

00:24:42.524 --> 00:24:43.525 line:-1
Do you?

00:24:43.692 --> 00:24:44.818 line:-1
- Well no, I don't.

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.445 line:-1
Do you?

00:24:47.612 --> 00:24:50.532 line:-2
- Well no, but I have this paperback.

00:24:52.158 --> 00:24:53.535 line:-2
- I'll buy my own book.

00:24:53.702 --> 00:24:54.577 line:-2
- It's out of print.

00:24:56.705 --> 00:24:57.580 line:-2
- You as a guide?

00:24:57.706 --> 00:24:58.581 line:-1
How much?

00:24:59.791 --> 00:25:00.917 line:-1
- Oh isn't that fine.

00:25:01.042 --> 00:25:02.794 line:-3
Just like you to treat me like a gigolo

00:25:02.961 --> 00:25:04.587 line:-3
and offer me money after all we meant to each other.

00:25:04.754 --> 00:25:05.630 line:-1
- How much?

00:25:05.797 --> 00:25:06.548 line:-1
- $25,000.

00:25:06.631 --> 00:25:07.966 line:-2
- Forget it. - 50 bucks?

00:25:08.049 --> 00:25:08.800 line:-1
- Okay.

00:25:11.136 --> 00:25:13.138 line:-2
- That's 50 plus expenses.

00:25:15.765 --> 00:25:17.809 line:-3
- Now Jim, I don't care what happened to us before.

00:25:17.976 --> 00:25:19.686 line:-3
That's all in the past.

00:25:19.853 --> 00:25:21.604 line:-3
I've hired you as a guide with the understanding

00:25:21.771 --> 00:25:22.772 line:-3
that our relationship will be

00:25:22.939 --> 00:25:25.108 line:-3
strictly professional from here on in.

00:25:25.233 --> 00:25:26.693 line:-3
- Whatever you say, honey buns.

00:25:30.071 --> 00:25:31.114 line:-1
- Get out.

00:25:31.281 --> 00:25:32.615 line:-1
- Okay, okay.

00:25:32.782 --> 00:25:33.700 line:-1
You're right.

00:25:33.867 --> 00:25:34.701 line:-1
I just slipped.

00:25:34.868 --> 00:25:35.785 line:-2
Strictly professional.

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:37.120 line:-3
That's the way you want, that's the way it'll be.

00:25:37.245 --> 00:25:37.996 line:-2
I'll be good, really.

00:25:38.121 --> 00:25:38.872 line:-1
I promise.

00:25:47.339 --> 00:25:50.091 line:-3
I guess sharing a sleeping bag is out then?

00:25:52.427 --> 00:25:55.096 line:-1
(orchestra music)

00:26:08.777 --> 00:26:09.861 line:-1
This is it.

00:26:10.028 --> 00:26:11.154 line:-1
The Avocado Jungle.

00:26:12.113 --> 00:26:13.740 line:-3
- It doesn't look like a jungle.

00:26:14.824 --> 00:26:16.659 line:-3
- The outer regions aren't very overgrown,

00:26:16.826 --> 00:26:19.120 line:-3
but the foliage gets thicker the deeper you go.

00:26:20.246 --> 00:26:22.749 line:-3
- We're gonna have to leave the jeep here and continue on foot.

00:26:22.916 --> 00:26:24.709 line:-2
- Yeah, well you girls better hang back.

00:26:24.876 --> 00:26:25.752 line:-2
This could be dangerous.

00:26:25.919 --> 00:26:27.587 line:-3
We don't wanna make any misstep.

00:26:28.797 --> 00:26:30.715 line:-2
- [Bunny] Are you okay?

00:26:30.882 --> 00:26:33.718 line:-3
- Yeah, yeah, just checking the tires.

00:26:34.803 --> 00:26:35.637 line:-2
Yeah, they're good.

00:26:36.471 --> 00:26:37.931 line:-2
I'll look at the oil later.

00:26:39.057 --> 00:26:40.058 line:-2
- He wrecked my nails.

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:46.523 line:-2
- There it is.

00:26:46.648 --> 00:26:48.274 line:-2
The Avocado Jungle.

00:26:48.441 --> 00:26:50.110 line:-2
Look around you, Bunny.

00:26:50.276 --> 00:26:53.196 line:-3
In front of us, the lush, untouched rainforest

00:26:53.363 --> 00:26:55.824 line:-3
of the last surviving matriarchy.

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:59.703 line:-2
Behind us, the polluted patriarchy of western civilization.

00:26:59.828 --> 00:27:02.205 line:-3
We're leaving a world dominated by men

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:04.958 line:-3
and entering one ruled by women.

00:27:05.125 --> 00:27:06.167 line:-3
- Whup -de -doo.

00:27:06.334 --> 00:27:07.585 line:-3
Just keep bashing men.

00:27:07.752 --> 00:27:08.712 line:-3
In a couple days you'll be dying

00:27:08.878 --> 00:27:10.755 line:-3
for a Burger King out here.

00:27:10.922 --> 00:27:11.881 line:-3
- I doubt it.

00:27:12.966 --> 00:27:14.801 line:-2
- You women, you're always bitching and moaning

00:27:14.968 --> 00:27:16.636 line:-3
about men and the way we run things,

00:27:16.803 --> 00:27:18.346 line:-3
but let's face it, who could have ever

00:27:18.513 --> 00:27:20.724 line:-3
invented but a man the '64 GTO?

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:22.809 line:-2
Or for that matter the Corvette Stingray.

00:27:22.976 --> 00:27:24.060 line:-3
Any year, any model.

00:27:24.227 --> 00:27:26.271 line:-3
All you women have ever done is, what?

00:27:26.438 --> 00:27:29.274 line:-3
Some French chick invented kryptonite or something.

00:27:29.441 --> 00:27:31.693 line:-3
The important things like beer and meat, that was all men.

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:32.902 line:-3
- Yeah, it's hard to imagine

00:27:33.069 --> 00:27:34.654 line:-2
a woman inventing nuclear weapons.

00:27:34.821 --> 00:27:36.031 line:-3
- [Jim] Exactly, and where would we be without them?

00:27:36.197 --> 00:27:37.699 line:-2
- [Margo] And the Nazi blitzkrieg seemed like a male idea.

00:27:37.866 --> 00:27:39.284 line:-2
Not to mention South African apartheid.

00:27:39.451 --> 00:27:41.286 line:-3
How about World War I, the Crusades,

00:27:41.453 --> 00:27:44.247 line:-3
the Spanish Inquisition, the rape of Shanghai?

00:27:44.414 --> 00:27:46.041 line:-2
- So men have done a lot of things.

00:27:47.876 --> 00:27:48.752 line:-2
- [Jim] Elvis Presley.

00:27:48.877 --> 00:27:50.837 line:-2
- [Margo] Janis Joplin.

00:27:51.004 --> 00:27:52.547 line:-3
- [Jim] Patton. - [Margo] Joan of Arc.

00:27:53.465 --> 00:27:54.591 line:-2
- [Jim] How about Tammy Bakker?

00:27:54.716 --> 00:27:56.760 line:-2
- [Margo] Jim Bakker, Jerry Falwell, Jimmy Swaggart.

00:27:56.885 --> 00:27:58.845 line:-3
- [Jim] Jessica Hunt, Fawn Hall, Donna Wright.

00:28:00.847 --> 00:28:01.973 line:-1
- Joseph McCarthy.

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:03.641 line:-1
Richard Nixon.

00:28:03.808 --> 00:28:04.684 line:-2
- [Jim] Joan Rivers.

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:06.603 line:-2
- Joan Rivers?

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:08.605 line:-3
I like Joan Rivers. I think she's funny.

00:28:08.772 --> 00:28:09.731 line:-3
- [Jim] Well I think Nixon's funny.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.986 line:-1
(snake hissing)

00:28:16.237 --> 00:28:18.865 line:-1
(birds chirping)

00:28:31.002 --> 00:28:32.295 line:-2
- Jim, what are you doing?

00:28:32.462 --> 00:28:33.755 line:-3
- Hacking out a trail through the underbrush.

00:28:33.922 --> 00:28:35.298 line:-3
- The trail is here, you're just

00:28:35.465 --> 00:28:37.592 line:-3
hacking at branches on the side.

00:28:39.052 --> 00:28:40.804 line:-3
- Yeah, but I just bought the machete.

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:42.847 line:-3
It seemed like a shame not to use it.

00:28:43.014 --> 00:28:43.807 line:-3
Anyway, it's good practice for when

00:28:43.932 --> 00:28:45.058 line:-3
the jungle really gets thick, you know?

00:28:45.225 --> 00:28:48.228 line:-3
Sometimes I swing two or three, then it's really light.

00:28:48.395 --> 00:28:51.356 line:-3
- I think you look really handsome with a machete.

00:28:51.523 --> 00:28:52.816 line:-3
- Well thank you, Bunny.

00:28:52.941 --> 00:28:54.275 line:-3
- [Margo] Come on you two!

00:28:54.442 --> 00:28:56.361 line:-3
We've got a lot of ground to cover before night!

00:28:56.528 --> 00:28:58.154 line:-3
- Girls before boys. - No no, boy, girl, boy, girl!

00:28:58.279 --> 00:28:59.114 line:-1
- No.

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.825 line:-3
- No, that's the way you do it in the jungle. - [Bunny]  No!

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:03.368 line:-2
- Hey.

00:29:03.535 --> 00:29:04.786 line:-2
Want some?

00:29:04.953 --> 00:29:05.870 line:-2
- Yeah.

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.665 line:-3
What is that?

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:09.874 line:-2
- Pina colada.

00:29:10.917 --> 00:29:12.002 line:-3
- Where's Bunny?

00:29:12.168 --> 00:29:13.253 line:-3
- That's funny.

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:15.046 line:-2
She was right...

00:29:15.213 --> 00:29:17.340 line:-2
- Bunny! - Bunny!

00:29:17.465 --> 00:29:18.258 line:-2
- Bunny! - Bunny!

00:29:21.886 --> 00:29:22.679 line:-2
- Kitty.

00:29:22.846 --> 00:29:24.848 line:-3
Aww, you're so cute.

00:29:24.973 --> 00:29:25.890 line:-1
Kitty.

00:29:26.057 --> 00:29:26.975 line:-3
Come here, aww.

00:29:27.142 --> 00:29:28.393 line:-2
(leopard purring)

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:29.310 line:-2
Good kitty.

00:29:29.394 --> 00:29:30.145 line:-2
Nice kitty.

00:29:31.521 --> 00:29:32.897 line:-3
Are you lost?

00:29:33.064 --> 00:29:33.982 line:-1
Huh?

00:29:35.108 --> 00:29:36.109 line:-3
Where's your home?

00:29:36.276 --> 00:29:37.736 line:-3
What do you like to eat?

00:29:38.945 --> 00:29:40.864 line:-3
Ooh, look at your eyes.

00:29:41.031 --> 00:29:42.282 line:-3
- [Jim] Bunny!

00:29:42.449 --> 00:29:43.408 line:-3
- Oh no.

00:29:43.575 --> 00:29:44.909 line:-3
- [Margo] Bunny!

00:29:45.076 --> 00:29:45.994 line:-2
- Bye.

00:29:50.915 --> 00:29:52.042 line:-1
Bye.

00:29:52.167 --> 00:29:53.376 line:-3
- [Margo] Bunny!

00:29:57.005 --> 00:29:58.173 line:-3
- [Jim] Bunny?

00:29:58.340 --> 00:29:59.090 line:-2
- Bunny!

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:01.926 line:-3
Oh, her curling iron.

00:30:02.093 --> 00:30:04.971 line:-1
- And her Indiana Jones lunchbox.

00:30:05.138 --> 00:30:05.889 line:-2
- Bunny!

00:30:06.014 --> 00:30:07.349 line:-3
- Whoa, look at all this stuff!

00:30:07.515 --> 00:30:09.392 line:-3
Milk Duds, Good 'N Plenty, Nutty Buddies!

00:30:09.517 --> 00:30:12.270 line:-3
I had a feeling she was holding out on us.

00:30:12.437 --> 00:30:13.188 line:-2
- Bunny!

00:30:14.439 --> 00:30:15.857 line:-3
- I just found a big kitty.

00:30:16.024 --> 00:30:16.900 line:-3
- Where have you been?

00:30:17.025 --> 00:30:18.193 line:-3
Don't you know it's dangerous in the jungle?

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.403 line:-3
- Don't you know it's dangerous to hold out on your friends?

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:21.446 line:-3
- Give me this.

00:30:21.613 --> 00:30:22.364 line:-2
- Ow!

00:30:23.656 --> 00:30:24.908 line:-3
Do you have a band-aid?

00:30:28.203 --> 00:30:30.955 line:-1
(playful music)

00:30:31.873 --> 00:30:34.501 line:-3
- You don't have any idea where we are?

00:30:34.668 --> 00:30:37.379 line:-2
- Of course I know where we are. I know exactly where we are.

00:30:37.545 --> 00:30:38.296 line:-2
- Oh good.

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:39.130 line:-2
- We're...

00:30:41.633 --> 00:30:44.928 line:-3
- Let me see that. - Honey, honey, honey, please!

00:30:46.096 --> 00:30:47.889 line:-3
I know you think you know everything about everything,

00:30:48.056 --> 00:30:50.934 line:-3
but when it comes to reading maps I happen to be an expert.

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:53.937 line:-3
All right, now our best chance of finding

00:30:54.104 --> 00:30:57.941 line:-3
the Piranha Women is to take the Rio Santa Rosa River.

00:30:58.066 --> 00:31:00.318 line:-3
It runs the length of The Avocado Jungle.

00:31:00.485 --> 00:31:03.488 line:-3
And it is, I believe, their primary source of fresh water.

00:31:03.655 --> 00:31:05.990 line:-3
- Well maybe we can build a raft and float downstream.

00:31:07.242 --> 00:31:08.827 line:-3
- Yeah, good, whatever.

00:31:08.993 --> 00:31:11.121 line:-2
All right, now according to my calculations,

00:31:11.287 --> 00:31:16.167 line:-3
with the North Star overhead and the moon rising easterly,

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.421 line:-3
and allowing for a wind factor of five,

00:31:19.587 --> 00:31:23.133 line:-3
the river should be approximately 23.6 miles away.

00:31:23.258 --> 00:31:25.385 line:-3
Should take us about two days to get there.

00:31:25.552 --> 00:31:26.511 line:-2
- 23 miles?

00:31:26.678 --> 00:31:28.304 line:-3
But the jungle is so lush and green around here.

00:31:28.471 --> 00:31:29.889 line:-3
Are you sure it's not closer?

00:31:30.056 --> 00:31:30.849 line:-2
I mean-

00:31:31.016 --> 00:31:33.184 line:-2
- Sweetie, sweetie ,sweetie, please!

00:31:33.351 --> 00:31:36.354 line:-3
If there's one thing I know, it's how to read a map.

00:31:36.521 --> 00:31:38.106 line:-3
Now if you will excuse me,

00:31:38.273 --> 00:31:39.983 line:-3
I gotta go to the little boy's room.

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:40.984 line:-3
Make yourselves busy.

00:31:41.151 --> 00:31:42.986 line:-3
God, women, you know?

00:31:43.111 --> 00:31:45.572 line:-2
They think they know about everything.

00:31:45.739 --> 00:31:46.489 line:-1
Ahh!

00:31:46.573 --> 00:31:49.159 line:-2
(big splash)

00:31:49.284 --> 00:31:51.786 line:-3
- I think he found the river.

00:31:59.544 --> 00:32:02.213 line:-3
- Maybe that isn't the North Star.

00:32:04.966 --> 00:32:07.427 line:-3
- They're all dry now, but I wanna get the wrinkles out.

00:32:07.594 --> 00:32:10.013 line:-3
- Maybe you put a neat military crease

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:12.557 line:-3
across the front panels of the pants and shirt.

00:32:12.724 --> 00:32:15.143 line:-2
- Oh sure!

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:16.936 line:-3
- You sure are a good little homemaker, Bunny.

00:32:17.103 --> 00:32:18.355 line:-2
- Thanks.

00:32:18.521 --> 00:32:19.981 line:-3
I've been taking home economics for two years now.

00:32:20.148 --> 00:32:23.026 line:-3
But I'm switching my major to feminist studies.

00:32:23.193 --> 00:32:24.069 line:-3
- What would you wanna do that for?

00:32:24.235 --> 00:32:25.528 line:-3
- I wanna expand my mind.

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:28.281 line:-2
- Why?

00:32:30.116 --> 00:32:31.284 line:-3
- Gee, I don't know.

00:32:31.451 --> 00:32:34.037 line:-3
Maybe I could become the first woman president or something.

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:40.960 line:-3
- I followed the river for about half a mile.

00:32:41.127 --> 00:32:42.212 line:-3
There's a wreckage of a small boat

00:32:42.379 --> 00:32:43.338 line:-3
that's out near the shore.

00:32:43.505 --> 00:32:45.298 line:-2
Now it's salvageable.

00:32:45.465 --> 00:32:48.051 line:-3
We could use it to travel downstream.

00:32:48.218 --> 00:32:50.470 line:-3
I wonder what it was doing this deep into the jungle.

00:32:50.637 --> 00:32:51.388 line:-2
- The Patna.

00:32:52.806 --> 00:32:54.432 line:-3
- You know it?

00:32:54.599 --> 00:32:55.350 line:-2
- Yes.

00:32:56.351 --> 00:32:57.435 line:-3
Yes, I know it.

00:33:00.105 --> 00:33:03.066 line:-3
It was a long, long time ago.

00:33:03.191 --> 00:33:04.359 line:-2
I was young.

00:33:04.526 --> 00:33:05.276 line:-2
Very young.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.070 line:-2
And stupid.

00:33:07.195 --> 00:33:08.279 line:-2
Very stupid.

00:33:08.446 --> 00:33:09.531 line:-3
I made a mistake.

00:33:09.698 --> 00:33:11.074 line:-2
Arab pilgrims.

00:33:11.241 --> 00:33:12.325 line:-2
A nasty business.

00:33:12.492 --> 00:33:13.535 line:-2
I panicked.

00:33:13.702 --> 00:33:15.078 line:-3
Got drummed out of the Merchant Marine.

00:33:15.245 --> 00:33:16.162 line:-3
Spent the next three years of my life

00:33:16.329 --> 00:33:18.998 line:-3
criss-crossing the globe trying to live it down.

00:33:20.625 --> 00:33:22.502 line:-3
I'm sorry, I don't wanna talk about it.

00:33:23.753 --> 00:33:24.587 line:-2
- Whatever.

00:33:24.713 --> 00:33:26.381 line:-3
- After that I crawled into a whiskey-

00:33:26.548 --> 00:33:27.465 line:-3
- Oh Jim, please.

00:33:27.632 --> 00:33:30.135 line:-3
Not the whiskey bottle again.

00:33:34.556 --> 00:33:36.141 line:-3
- Poor Jimmy doesn't have a tent.

00:33:37.517 --> 00:33:39.144 line:-3
- Bunny, he'll be all right.

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:41.104 line:-3
It's a warm night.

00:33:41.271 --> 00:33:42.105 line:-2
- Listen.

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:44.065 line:-2
Isn't it beautiful?

00:33:44.232 --> 00:33:46.943 line:-1
(harmonica music)

00:33:48.737 --> 00:33:50.321 line:-3
- He is awfully good.

00:34:07.339 --> 00:34:09.966 line:-3
- You're kinda tough on him.

00:34:10.133 --> 00:34:10.884 line:-2
- Yeah.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.553 line:-3
- He said he loved you.

00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:16.306 line:-3
- I doubt that.

00:34:16.431 --> 00:34:18.016 line:-3
It never would've worked out.

00:34:19.351 --> 00:34:23.188 line:-2
He's an egotistical, chauvinistic klutz.

00:34:23.355 --> 00:34:24.522 line:-3
- I think he's kinda cute.

00:34:29.235 --> 00:34:31.112 line:-3
- Well maybe I am a little hard on him.

00:34:32.864 --> 00:34:37.243 line:-3
Bunny, it's just that he represents my failures.

00:34:37.410 --> 00:34:38.995 line:-2
- Failures? - You?

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.663 line:-3
- Sure, we all have them.

00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:43.333 line:-3
Can I tell you a secret I've never told anyone before?

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.126 line:-2
- Sure.

00:34:45.293 --> 00:34:46.211 line:-3
- In a way, Jim is right.

00:34:47.587 --> 00:34:48.421 line:-3
I am afraid of men.

00:34:50.423 --> 00:34:53.218 line:-3
My relationships have been, well,

00:34:53.385 --> 00:34:55.178 line:-3
I've had a lot of one night stands.

00:34:56.304 --> 00:34:59.182 line:-3
A little to drink, you know, give myself an excuse.

00:34:59.349 --> 00:35:01.101 line:-3
And I subconsciously fall for jerks

00:35:01.267 --> 00:35:03.478 line:-3
I know I'll never be emotionally involved with.

00:35:04.771 --> 00:35:06.398 line:-3
It's all so empty.

00:35:06.564 --> 00:35:07.399 line:-1
Passionless, really.

00:35:09.442 --> 00:35:13.238 line:-3
I guess deep down I'm afraid that there can never

00:35:13.405 --> 00:35:16.741 line:-3
be any real respect or equality between the sexes.

00:35:16.908 --> 00:35:18.201 line:-2
Not really.

00:35:18.326 --> 00:35:19.703 line:-3
I've avoided commitment because I'm afraid

00:35:19.869 --> 00:35:22.414 line:-3
I'll be emotionally dominated by my lover.

00:35:23.748 --> 00:35:26.251 line:-3
Or equally as sad, I dominate him.

00:35:28.336 --> 00:35:30.505 line:-2
I guess that seems kinda strange huh?

00:35:30.672 --> 00:35:32.298 line:-3
- Can I tell you something too, Dr. Hunt?

00:35:32.465 --> 00:35:34.050 line:-3
Something I've never told anybody before?

00:35:34.217 --> 00:35:35.218 line:-3
- Of course, Bunny.

00:35:35.385 --> 00:35:37.262 line:-3
I'm glad we get to share this.

00:35:37.429 --> 00:35:39.514 line:-3
- Well sometimes when I'm with a guy,

00:35:39.681 --> 00:35:42.434 line:-3
I wish that he'd tie me up with red licorice ropes.

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.394 line:-3
And then spank me.

00:35:44.561 --> 00:35:47.230 line:-3
And then he'd eat the ropes.

00:35:47.355 --> 00:35:49.065 line:-3
And then he'd free me.

00:35:49.899 --> 00:35:51.067 line:-3
And then we'd make love while

00:35:51.192 --> 00:35:52.610 line:-3
the Philharmonic played Bolero.

00:35:55.238 --> 00:35:56.072 line:-3
- Thank you, Bunny.

00:35:57.073 --> 00:35:59.701 line:-3
You really put my thoughts in perspective.

00:35:59.868 --> 00:36:00.744 line:-3
- I feel better too.

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:06.332 line:-3
- Hey, you want some red licorice?

00:36:06.499 --> 00:36:07.459 line:-2
- No thanks.

00:36:07.625 --> 00:36:09.461 line:-3
- How about you, Bun?

00:36:09.627 --> 00:36:10.545 line:-3
Come on, it's a foot -long.

00:36:10.712 --> 00:36:12.297 line:-3
Start on the end, I'll meet you in the middle.

00:36:14.466 --> 00:36:15.759 line:-2
- No thanks.

00:36:15.925 --> 00:36:17.344 line:-2
- Suit yourself.

00:36:20.764 --> 00:36:23.808 line:-3
(Jim hums Bolero)

00:36:23.975 --> 00:36:25.643 line:-3
- Let's see if this boat floats, huh?

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:27.270 line:-3
What do you say?

00:36:27.437 --> 00:36:28.188 line:-3
- And over here on the left we have

00:36:28.313 --> 00:36:30.273 line:-3
the tribal headhunter and trader.

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:31.775 line:-3
He's got a special for us today.

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.234 line:-3
It's a two -for -one.

00:36:33.401 --> 00:36:35.278 line:-3
Two of his heads for one of yours.

00:36:35.403 --> 00:36:36.863 line:-3
Do we have any takers?

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:38.239 line:-2
- This is why this is incredible.

00:36:38.406 --> 00:36:39.616 line:-3
He's memorized the entire speech

00:36:39.741 --> 00:36:42.202 line:-2
from the Jungle Boat ride at Disneyland.

00:36:42.369 --> 00:36:43.787 line:-3
- That'll be useful.

00:36:43.953 --> 00:36:45.455 line:-3
- I can do the Tiki Room too.

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.582 line:-3
- You know everything! - Can you steer the boat?

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:53.713 line:-3
- Hey, I know Adventureland like the back of my hand.

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.383 line:-3
Of course this jungle can't be much different.

00:36:56.549 --> 00:36:57.342 line:-2
(loud thump)

00:36:57.509 --> 00:36:58.259 line:-3
- What was that?

00:36:58.385 --> 00:36:59.260 line:-3
- Something went under the boat.

00:36:59.427 --> 00:37:00.387 line:-1
Something big.

00:37:00.553 --> 00:37:02.389 line:-3
- It's probably just a rock.

00:37:02.555 --> 00:37:03.306 line:-2
- Hardly.

00:37:05.975 --> 00:37:07.352 line:-3
A hippo, look!

00:37:07.519 --> 00:37:08.436 line:-2
- A hippo?

00:37:08.603 --> 00:37:09.729 line:-2
In California?

00:37:09.896 --> 00:37:10.814 line:-3
- The Palm Springs hippo.

00:37:10.939 --> 00:37:12.482 line:-3
It's a lighter version than its African cousin

00:37:12.607 --> 00:37:14.401 line:-3
because of the low -cholesterol diet.

00:37:14.567 --> 00:37:16.277 line:-3
But it's just as deadly.

00:37:16.444 --> 00:37:17.195 line:-2
(hippo roars)

00:37:17.362 --> 00:37:18.154 line:-3
- Oh my god, it's charging at the boat!

00:37:18.279 --> 00:37:19.698 line:-3
- We're gonna die! - Man the helm!

00:37:19.864 --> 00:37:21.491 line:-3
- Don't let it broadside us, Jim!

00:37:21.616 --> 00:37:23.326 line:-3
Hard to port, hard to port!

00:37:23.451 --> 00:37:24.744 line:-3
- Port, is that left or right?

00:37:24.911 --> 00:37:25.870 line:-3
- Left, left!

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:29.666 line:-3
- [Bunny] Is it dead?

00:37:29.833 --> 00:37:30.792 line:-3
- I think so.

00:37:32.002 --> 00:37:34.170 line:-3
- Boy, did its ears wiggle when it

00:37:34.295 --> 00:37:35.171 line:-3
started to get close to us?

00:37:35.296 --> 00:37:37.507 line:-3
- Yeah, the ears wiggle when they're angry.

00:37:37.674 --> 00:37:38.883 line:-2
- Yeah.

00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:41.428 line:-3
- This is not the Disneyland jungle boat ride!

00:37:41.594 --> 00:37:42.387 line:-3
Get real, folks!

00:37:42.554 --> 00:37:43.555 line:-3
We were almost killed!

00:37:46.474 --> 00:37:48.893 line:-2
(birds chirping)

00:38:07.495 --> 00:38:10.331 line:-2
(ducks quacking)

00:38:21.009 --> 00:38:21.760 line:-1
Shh.

00:38:23.803 --> 00:38:24.971 line:-3
There's something in the bushes.

00:38:25.138 --> 00:38:27.474 line:-3
- I think I hear something.

00:38:30.435 --> 00:38:31.311 line:-2
Oh lordy!

00:38:31.478 --> 00:38:32.354 line:-2
- Get down.

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:33.521 line:-2
- They're attacking!

00:38:33.688 --> 00:38:34.439 line:-1
Whoa!

00:38:36.024 --> 00:38:37.192 line:-2
- I'm coming.

00:38:39.819 --> 00:38:41.780 line:-3
Where does it hurt?

00:38:41.946 --> 00:38:42.864 line:-3
- I can't tell.

00:38:43.031 --> 00:38:44.366 line:-3
I think I'm in shock.

00:38:45.533 --> 00:38:46.409 line:-2
Am I bleeding?

00:38:46.534 --> 00:38:47.410 line:-3
- [Bunny] No.

00:38:47.577 --> 00:38:49.579 line:-3
- What was it that did me in?

00:38:49.746 --> 00:38:51.247 line:-3
Was it a rock?

00:38:51.414 --> 00:38:52.707 line:-2
A spear?

00:38:52.874 --> 00:38:53.667 line:-2
An arrow?

00:38:53.833 --> 00:38:56.461 line:-3
- Looks like a knitted potholder to me.

00:38:56.628 --> 00:38:58.421 line:-3
- It looks like a doily.

00:39:00.131 --> 00:39:03.426 line:-3
- Looks like a crocheted potholder.

00:39:03.551 --> 00:39:06.429 line:-3
Boy, those Piranha Women are stupider than I thought.

00:39:06.596 --> 00:39:07.430 line:-2
What did they think they're gonna get attacking us

00:39:07.597 --> 00:39:10.475 line:-3
with doilies and potholders and placemats?

00:39:10.642 --> 00:39:13.395 line:-3
Women today are just not the way I thought they'd be.

00:39:14.437 --> 00:39:16.898 line:-3
- Well I don't think it's the Piranha Women.

00:39:17.065 --> 00:39:18.483 line:-3
Whoever it is, they're gone now.

00:39:19.818 --> 00:39:21.277 line:-2
Let's go investigate.

00:39:21.444 --> 00:39:22.612 line:-2
- Wait.

00:39:22.779 --> 00:39:25.407 line:-3
They could have flatware. It might be dangerous.

00:39:25.573 --> 00:39:26.324 line:-3
- [Bunny] Why would somebody

00:39:26.408 --> 00:39:28.368 line:-3
attack our boat with potholders?

00:39:28.535 --> 00:39:30.370 line:-3
- Well maybe it wasn't meant as an attack.

00:39:30.537 --> 00:39:32.706 line:-3
Maybe it was meant as an offering.

00:39:32.872 --> 00:39:34.290 line:-3
- [Jim] An offering?

00:39:34.457 --> 00:39:35.834 line:-2
Oh god, you don't mean... - Yes!

00:39:35.917 --> 00:39:36.876 line:-1
- Who?

00:39:37.043 --> 00:39:38.461 line:-3
- Let's go back to the boat.

00:39:38.628 --> 00:39:40.380 line:-3
- No, we can't go back.

00:39:40.547 --> 00:39:42.966 line:-3
We want to be the first outsiders ever to make contact.

00:39:43.133 --> 00:39:44.300 line:-3
- [Jim] They're disgusting!

00:39:44.426 --> 00:39:45.510 line:-3
- [Bunny] Who?

00:39:45.677 --> 00:39:46.469 line:-2
- [Margo] They're not disgusting.

00:39:46.636 --> 00:39:47.554 line:-3
You think that anyone who chooses to live

00:39:47.721 --> 00:39:50.849 line:-3
their life differently from you is disgusting.

00:39:51.016 --> 00:39:54.477 line:-3
Well different lifestyles have different traditions, Jim.

00:39:54.602 --> 00:39:55.353 line:-3
- [Jim] They're sniveling worms and I don't

00:39:55.437 --> 00:39:56.980 line:-3
have the stomach to look at them.

00:39:57.105 --> 00:39:58.898 line:-3
- [Bunny] Who? - It's just a legend, really.

00:39:59.065 --> 00:40:01.985 line:-3
But in The Avocado Jungle there's a tribe of men

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:03.611 line:-3
who live apart from the Piranha Women.

00:40:03.778 --> 00:40:06.031 line:-3
- And who cower in fear of them.

00:40:06.197 --> 00:40:07.532 line:-3
- They have different cultures, Jim.

00:40:07.699 --> 00:40:09.701 line:-3
They're really very caring and nurturing.

00:40:09.868 --> 00:40:11.036 line:-2
- [Jim] They're a bunch of weenies!

00:40:11.202 --> 00:40:12.620 line:-2
- They make potholders?

00:40:12.787 --> 00:40:15.081 line:-3
- Well they make baked goods, sew their own clothes,

00:40:15.248 --> 00:40:17.542 line:-3
and they leave out handicrafts for the Piranha Women.

00:40:17.709 --> 00:40:19.878 line:-3
And in return, they don't eat them.

00:40:21.296 --> 00:40:22.714 line:-3
Kinda a symbiotic relationship.

00:40:24.132 --> 00:40:26.634 line:-3
- Kinda an idiotic relationship is more like it.

00:40:28.136 --> 00:40:29.429 line:-3
- What are they called?

00:40:29.596 --> 00:40:30.722 line:-2
- The Donnahews.

00:40:30.889 --> 00:40:32.640 line:-3
Come on out, don't be afraid!

00:40:32.807 --> 00:40:34.017 line:-3
- [Bunny] We won't eat you.

00:40:34.184 --> 00:40:37.437 line:-3
We promise. - Don't be afraid, look.

00:40:37.604 --> 00:40:38.730 line:-2
I'm an ethnographer.

00:40:38.897 --> 00:40:41.733 line:-3
(goofy tuba music)

00:40:44.819 --> 00:40:47.530 line:-3
- Good god, what wimps!

00:40:47.697 --> 00:40:49.407 line:-3
- It's a different culture, Jim.

00:40:50.492 --> 00:40:51.576 line:-3
- I think they're sweet.

00:40:55.747 --> 00:40:56.539 line:-3
- Thank you.

00:40:56.664 --> 00:40:57.874 line:-2
It's beautiful.

00:40:58.041 --> 00:40:59.125 line:-3
- [Donnahews] Donnahew!

00:40:59.292 --> 00:41:00.710 line:-2
Alan Alda!

00:41:00.835 --> 00:41:02.545 line:-2
Mark Harmon!

00:41:02.671 --> 00:41:03.588 line:-2
Walter Mondale!

00:41:05.048 --> 00:41:07.384 line:-3
- Get off of me, you wuss!

00:41:07.509 --> 00:41:08.718 line:-2
Get away!

00:41:08.843 --> 00:41:10.553 line:-3
Ugh, I'm not getting on my knees!

00:41:10.679 --> 00:41:11.429 line:-3
Great suffering Christ man,

00:41:11.513 --> 00:41:14.557 line:-3
they're just a couple of chicks!

00:41:14.724 --> 00:41:17.644 line:-3
(lute and bongo music)

00:41:24.025 --> 00:41:25.110 line:-2
- Donnahew?

00:41:25.276 --> 00:41:26.486 line:-3
- Oh thank you, no, I'm stuffed, really.

00:41:26.653 --> 00:41:28.613 line:-3
It was all delicious though.

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:30.073 line:-3
- Alan Alda?

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.074 line:-3
- Thank you, no.

00:41:31.199 --> 00:41:32.784 line:-3
- Oh yes, thank you.

00:41:32.951 --> 00:41:34.661 line:-2
This tuna fish casserole is a dream.

00:41:34.828 --> 00:41:36.538 line:-3
And the stuffed bell peppers?

00:41:36.705 --> 00:41:37.664 line:-3
They're so good.

00:41:37.831 --> 00:41:38.665 line:-3
Aren't they really good cooks?

00:41:38.832 --> 00:41:41.501 line:-3
- Really good wimps is what they are.

00:41:41.668 --> 00:41:43.044 line:-3
- Why does it bother you so much

00:41:43.211 --> 00:41:44.504 line:-2
to see men cooking and performing

00:41:44.671 --> 00:41:46.673 line:-3
tasks generally relegated to women?

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:47.674 line:-3
They seem happy enough.

00:41:49.009 --> 00:41:50.468 line:-2
You act as if your own masculinity

00:41:50.635 --> 00:41:51.636 line:-2
were threatened because another man

00:41:51.803 --> 00:41:54.014 line:-3
performs a supposedly feminine task.

00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:55.682 line:-3
Why don't you just be yourself

00:41:55.849 --> 00:41:56.891 line:-3
and let them be who they are?

00:41:57.058 --> 00:41:59.102 line:-3
(Jim spits) - Because, sorry pal.

00:41:59.269 --> 00:42:01.438 line:-3
Because no man can be truly happy acting

00:42:01.604 --> 00:42:04.733 line:-3
as a housemaid to a bunch of man -eaters.

00:42:04.899 --> 00:42:07.610 line:-3
Cooking and sewing just aren't in the male hormones.

00:42:07.777 --> 00:42:09.571 line:-3
These poor, desperate wretches don't know

00:42:09.738 --> 00:42:10.613 line:-3
any better 'cause they don't have any

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:13.074 line:-2
role models like John Wayne or Stallone.

00:42:13.241 --> 00:42:13.992 line:-2
If they did-

00:42:14.075 --> 00:42:15.452 line:-3
- They'd be violent,

00:42:15.618 --> 00:42:18.663 line:-3
emotionally repressed, and narrow -minded.

00:42:19.873 --> 00:42:21.750 line:-3
- Just like my heroes.

00:42:21.916 --> 00:42:23.460 line:-3
Strong and masculine and virile.

00:42:24.586 --> 00:42:27.005 line:-3
Hey buddy, is there any more of that kiwi tart left?

00:42:27.172 --> 00:42:28.173 line:-3
And can I get a chair?

00:42:31.801 --> 00:42:32.719 line:-3
- Oh my.

00:42:33.803 --> 00:42:34.763 line:-1
Beautiful!

00:42:35.889 --> 00:42:36.848 line:-3
Oh you made it yourself?

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:41.603 line:-3
It's wonderful, but really, my apartment is so small.

00:42:42.854 --> 00:42:44.773 line:-2
Really, I couldn't.

00:42:44.939 --> 00:42:45.690 line:-2
Nice though.

00:42:45.774 --> 00:42:46.858 line:-2
Very nice.

00:42:47.025 --> 00:42:47.776 line:-3
- I have a lot of fantasies

00:42:47.859 --> 00:42:48.651 line:-3
about being tied up and spanked.

00:42:48.777 --> 00:42:51.029 line:-3
I suppose it isn't very liberated is it?

00:42:51.196 --> 00:42:53.948 line:-2
What kind of fantasies do feminists have?

00:42:54.115 --> 00:42:55.658 line:-2
- Bunny, please go to sleep!

00:42:55.784 --> 00:42:57.660 line:-3
We have to get up early and look for the Piranha Women.

00:42:57.827 --> 00:43:00.663 line:-3
- What kind of fantasies do Piranha Women have?

00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:02.749 line:-3
Eating men, I suppose.

00:43:02.916 --> 00:43:04.542 line:-1
Charbroiled or baked?

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:12.759 line:-2
- Donnahew.

00:43:12.926 --> 00:43:13.677 line:-2
Alan Alda.

00:43:13.802 --> 00:43:15.637 line:-3
- Oh great, I could use a drink.

00:43:18.723 --> 00:43:19.849 line:-2
What is...

00:43:20.016 --> 00:43:21.601 line:-2
Hot chocolate?

00:43:22.727 --> 00:43:26.731 line:-3
Jesus H. Christ, men don't bring other men hot chocolate!

00:43:29.359 --> 00:43:32.487 line:-3
Guys, this is no way to live.

00:43:33.988 --> 00:43:36.199 line:-3
What's killing me I know that deep inside

00:43:36.324 --> 00:43:37.701 line:-3
every last of you beats the heart

00:43:37.826 --> 00:43:40.704 line:-3
of a virile, macho, manly man.

00:43:42.163 --> 00:43:44.124 line:-3
And I'll be goddamned if I sit idly by

00:43:44.290 --> 00:43:45.709 line:-3
and watch you all waste away your lives

00:43:45.834 --> 00:43:48.586 line:-3
as a bunch of sniveling, cowardly wimps.

00:43:51.923 --> 00:43:54.092 line:-3
Tonight I'm gonna teach you all how to be men.

00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:56.761 line:-3
And I know just how to do it.

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:01.641 line:-1
Beer!

00:44:03.977 --> 00:44:04.769 line:-1
There!

00:44:04.936 --> 00:44:06.104 line:-3
See what it is to be a man!

00:44:15.864 --> 00:44:16.740 line:-1
Ha!

00:44:16.865 --> 00:44:17.824 line:-1
Take it!

00:44:17.991 --> 00:44:18.742 line:-2
Do it!

00:44:18.825 --> 00:44:20.744 line:-3
Come on, I know you want it!

00:44:20.869 --> 00:44:21.619 line:-3
Be a man!

00:44:22.454 --> 00:44:23.329 line:-2
Do it!

00:44:23.496 --> 00:44:24.748 line:-1
Beer!

00:44:24.914 --> 00:44:26.291 line:-3
Come on, you're the chief!

00:44:26.458 --> 00:44:28.251 line:-3
Show them what you got!

00:44:28.418 --> 00:44:30.795 line:-2
(tense music)

00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:46.936 line:-3
("Also Sprach Zarathustra" remix music)

00:45:13.463 --> 00:45:14.923 line:-1
Yeah!

00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:16.007 line:-3
Come on, boys!

00:45:16.174 --> 00:45:17.717 line:-3
Pass them out!

00:45:17.884 --> 00:45:18.635 line:-1
Beer!

00:45:21.054 --> 00:45:21.805 line:-1
Beer!

00:45:21.888 --> 00:45:22.764 line:-1
Beer!

00:45:22.931 --> 00:45:23.682 line:-1
Beer!

00:45:23.765 --> 00:45:24.516 line:-1
Beer!

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:28.853 line:-3
(Donnahews chanting "beer")

00:45:29.938 --> 00:45:30.897 line:-1
Beer!

00:45:31.064 --> 00:45:31.815 line:-1
Beer!

00:45:31.898 --> 00:45:34.150 line:-3
Beer! Beer! Beer!

00:45:40.031 --> 00:45:41.074 line:-3
All right boys.

00:45:41.241 --> 00:45:44.160 line:-3
Keep drinking, there's plenty more where that came from.

00:45:44.285 --> 00:45:45.662 line:-3
All right, now we're gonna have

00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:48.289 line:-3
a little pop quiz here on what we learned.

00:45:48.456 --> 00:45:49.874 line:-2
Pay attention.

00:45:50.041 --> 00:45:51.167 line:-2
Eyes front.

00:45:51.292 --> 00:45:52.836 line:-1
Now.

00:45:53.003 --> 00:45:53.753 line:-1
What's that?

00:45:55.046 --> 00:45:55.797 line:-3
- [Donnahews] Beer!

00:45:55.922 --> 00:45:56.881 line:-3
- Yeah, all right.

00:45:57.966 --> 00:45:58.883 line:-3
Here we go.

00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:01.219 line:-1
What's that?

00:46:01.386 --> 00:46:02.345 line:-3
- [Donnahews] Penthouse!

00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:03.680 line:-3
- Penthouse, yes.

00:46:03.847 --> 00:46:04.848 line:-1
Okay.

00:46:05.015 --> 00:46:06.307 line:-1
What's that?

00:46:06.474 --> 00:46:08.685 line:-3
- [Donnahews] Keys to the Chevy!

00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:10.020 line:-3
- Right on!

00:46:10.186 --> 00:46:11.312 line:-2
Good men.

00:46:11.479 --> 00:46:12.313 line:-3
All right, now.

00:46:14.107 --> 00:46:15.692 line:-3
Let's take a little scenario here.

00:46:18.361 --> 00:46:21.906 line:-3
Let's say you're riding down the street in your Corvette.

00:46:22.907 --> 00:46:24.868 line:-3
You got one hand on the wheel, palming it.

00:46:25.035 --> 00:46:27.704 line:-3
Got one eye out looking for the cops.

00:46:27.871 --> 00:46:29.372 line:-3
You spot out of the corner of your eye

00:46:29.497 --> 00:46:31.708 line:-3
walking down the street in some sexy

00:46:31.875 --> 00:46:33.835 line:-3
hot pants some buxom teen talent.

00:46:36.254 --> 00:46:37.172 line:-3
You know, a dame!

00:46:38.381 --> 00:46:40.842 line:-3
A girl, a broad, a wench!

00:46:41.009 --> 00:46:42.260 line:-1
Woman!

00:46:42.427 --> 00:46:43.720 line:-3
So what do you do?

00:46:45.138 --> 00:46:45.930 line:-3
No no, get back!

00:46:46.097 --> 00:46:47.223 line:-3
You don't run and hide!

00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:48.767 line:-3
Get back there!

00:46:49.559 --> 00:46:50.977 line:-2
Jesus Christ!

00:46:51.144 --> 00:46:52.145 line:-3
What do you do?

00:46:53.355 --> 00:46:56.983 line:-3
No no, you don't offer them knitted products!

00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:57.942 line:-3
Men don't knit!

00:46:59.611 --> 00:47:01.071 line:-3
You yell out to her!

00:47:01.237 --> 00:47:03.281 line:-3
You yell out "Hey, sexy mama!"

00:47:04.657 --> 00:47:08.953 line:-3
"Hey, love machine, you wanna go for a ride in my 'vette?"

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:10.997 line:-3
So let's try it, all right?

00:47:11.164 --> 00:47:11.956 line:-1
Okay?

00:47:12.123 --> 00:47:14.042 line:-3
Hey, sexy mama!

00:47:14.959 --> 00:47:17.087 line:-3
- [Donnahews] Hey, sexy mama.

00:47:19.172 --> 00:47:20.924 line:-3
- Hey, love machine!

00:47:22.175 --> 00:47:24.260 line:-3
- [Donnahews] Hey, love machine.

00:47:24.427 --> 00:47:25.762 line:-3
- That's it.

00:47:25.887 --> 00:47:27.180 line:-3
You wanna go for a ride in my 'vette?

00:47:28.556 --> 00:47:31.518 line:-3
- [Donnahews] You wanna go for a ride in my 'vette?

00:47:31.685 --> 00:47:32.435 line:-2
- Yeah!

00:47:32.519 --> 00:47:33.269 line:-3
That was pretty good, all right.

00:47:33.436 --> 00:47:35.438 line:-3
Go ahead boys, you earned another swig.

00:47:42.112 --> 00:47:43.029 line:-1
Yeah.

00:47:47.701 --> 00:47:48.451 line:-2
Hey, fellas.

00:47:50.245 --> 00:47:50.995 line:-2
Take five.

00:47:55.667 --> 00:47:56.960 line:-3
- Excuse me.

00:47:57.085 --> 00:47:57.961 line:-1
Hi.

00:47:58.086 --> 00:47:59.963 line:-3
I heard all the noise and I couldn't sleep,

00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:01.256 line:-3
so I thought maybe one of you

00:48:01.423 --> 00:48:03.216 line:-2
could make me some hot chocolate.

00:48:03.383 --> 00:48:04.134 line:-1
- Chick.

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:05.051 line:-1
- Broad.

00:48:05.135 --> 00:48:06.302 line:-1
- Sexy mama.

00:48:06.469 --> 00:48:07.220 line:-1
- What?

00:48:09.097 --> 00:48:10.849 line:-2
- Hey, baby.

00:48:11.016 --> 00:48:13.560 line:-3
You wanna go for a ride in my 'vette?

00:48:13.727 --> 00:48:15.311 line:-3
- I don't know, where's it parked?

00:48:17.689 --> 00:48:20.859 line:-3
- Hey love machine, let's do it dirty.

00:48:22.152 --> 00:48:23.445 line:-2
- Love machine?

00:48:23.611 --> 00:48:25.613 line:-3
What happened to tuna casseroles and needle point?

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:27.073 line:-3
I mean all I came out here for

00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:29.034 line:-3
was to ask for some hot chocolate.

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.118 line:-2
Dr. Hunt!

00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:33.038 line:-2
Dr. Hunt!

00:48:34.456 --> 00:48:37.834 line:-1
(scurrying cries)

00:48:38.001 --> 00:48:39.085 line:-3
- Let go of Bunny!

00:48:39.252 --> 00:48:40.003 line:-2
- No!

00:48:42.088 --> 00:48:44.215 line:-1
(Bunny sobs)

00:48:44.382 --> 00:48:49.262 line:-3
- What are you doing out here?

00:48:53.141 --> 00:48:54.476 line:-3
- Look, I'm sorry, all right?

00:48:54.642 --> 00:48:55.393 line:-2
I'm sorry.

00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:57.187 line:-3
I mean it, I'm sorry.

00:48:57.312 --> 00:48:58.355 line:-3
It's just that we had a party

00:48:58.521 --> 00:49:01.149 line:-3
and the boys got a little out of control.

00:49:01.316 --> 00:49:03.109 line:-2
- Out of control?

00:49:03.276 --> 00:49:05.487 line:-3
They tried to gang rape Bunny.

00:49:05.653 --> 00:49:08.031 line:-2
- And I didn't get any hot chocolate.

00:49:08.156 --> 00:49:09.866 line:-2
- Gang rape her, huh?

00:49:10.033 --> 00:49:12.577 line:-3
Boy, I didn't know they had it in them.

00:49:12.744 --> 00:49:13.995 line:-2
- Jerk.

00:49:14.162 --> 00:49:14.913 line:-3
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean it that way.

00:49:15.038 --> 00:49:16.081 line:-2
I meant...

00:49:16.247 --> 00:49:18.291 line:-3
Bunny, you know what I meant, right?

00:49:18.458 --> 00:49:19.376 line:-3
- I guess so.

00:49:19.501 --> 00:49:21.920 line:-3
- It's just that, considering how faggy

00:49:22.087 --> 00:49:24.547 line:-3
they were acting, it was kinda delightful to see them

00:49:24.714 --> 00:49:27.300 line:-3
finally taking a healthy interest in the opposite sex.

00:49:28.301 --> 00:49:29.219 line:-2
- God.

00:49:29.386 --> 00:49:31.096 line:-3
A healthy interest to you means a violent one.

00:49:31.971 --> 00:49:33.390 line:-3
- Oh, yeah, like your little

00:49:33.515 --> 00:49:35.141 line:-3
Piranha Women don't resort to violence.

00:49:35.308 --> 00:49:37.519 line:-3
They only kill, slice up, and eat men.

00:49:37.686 --> 00:49:38.895 line:-3
- Quite right, and I'm beginning

00:49:39.062 --> 00:49:40.605 line:-3
to think they've got the right idea.

00:49:45.527 --> 00:49:48.321 line:-1
(orchestral music)

00:50:06.297 --> 00:50:09.342 line:-3
- Oh fudge a duck, the propeller's stuck again.

00:50:10.385 --> 00:50:12.012 line:-3
There's too much grass in this area.

00:50:12.178 --> 00:50:13.013 line:-3
- Look, we're just gonna have to drag it

00:50:13.179 --> 00:50:15.598 line:-3
downstream where there's deeper water.

00:50:15.724 --> 00:50:17.600 line:-3
- Drag it?

00:50:17.767 --> 00:50:20.353 line:-3
- Yeah, drag it. - You got us into this mess.

00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:22.522 line:-3
- Oh, you mean we have to get in the water?

00:50:23.773 --> 00:50:25.275 line:-3
I didn't even bring any trunks.

00:50:41.207 --> 00:50:42.167 line:-3
Ew, ew, ew!

00:50:43.209 --> 00:50:45.295 line:-2
- What, leeches? - No, catfish.

00:50:45.462 --> 00:50:46.296 line:-1
- Catfish?

00:50:46.463 --> 00:50:47.630 line:-3
Catfish don't bite.

00:50:47.756 --> 00:50:49.215 line:-3
- I know, but they swished all around

00:50:49.382 --> 00:50:51.301 line:-3
my ankles and it feels icky.

00:50:51.468 --> 00:50:54.179 line:-3
I always hated catfish, even as a kid.

00:50:54.346 --> 00:50:57.182 line:-3
There's no ickier feeling than catfish swishing around.

00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:58.141 line:-3
I mean what if one crawled up

00:50:58.266 --> 00:50:59.142 line:-3
my pants leg and swam up-

00:50:59.309 --> 00:51:00.352 line:-3
- Oh shut up with the catfish.

00:51:00.518 --> 00:51:02.604 line:-3
If you wanna get back in the boat, get back in the boat.

00:51:02.771 --> 00:51:06.066 line:-3
- Margo, me think thou doth protest too much.

00:51:07.484 --> 00:51:09.152 line:-3
- What's that supposed to mean?

00:51:10.278 --> 00:51:12.489 line:-3
- You're always mad at me, you're always yelling at me.

00:51:12.614 --> 00:51:14.991 line:-3
I'm sure a big doctor like you know that underneath

00:51:15.158 --> 00:51:17.327 line:-3
that means you're just hiding your true feelings.

00:51:18.286 --> 00:51:19.204 line:-3
- Which is?

00:51:19.371 --> 00:51:21.373 line:-3
- That you really love me.

00:51:21.539 --> 00:51:22.332 line:-1
- I don't love you.

00:51:22.457 --> 00:51:24.209 line:-1
I don't even like you.

00:51:24.376 --> 00:51:26.586 line:-3
- Then why is your voice quivering as you say that?

00:51:26.753 --> 00:51:28.213 line:-3
- My voice is not quivering.

00:51:29.422 --> 00:51:30.507 line:-3
- Yes it is.

00:51:30.632 --> 00:51:32.175 line:-2
It is.

00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:34.135 line:-3
You can always tell when a woman's in love.

00:51:34.302 --> 00:51:36.513 line:-3
Because their voice quivers when she speaks.

00:51:36.638 --> 00:51:39.265 line:-3
- My voice is not quivering!

00:51:39.432 --> 00:51:40.350 line:-2
- Why are you getting so emotional?

00:51:40.475 --> 00:51:42.227 line:-3
- I'm not emotional. - It's quivering again.

00:51:43.269 --> 00:51:44.729 line:-2
- I'm not emotional or quivering!

00:51:45.814 --> 00:51:47.524 line:-3
- Margo, are you getting your period?

00:51:49.526 --> 00:51:50.694 line:-3
- No, I'm not getting my period.

00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:53.154 line:-3
It's not due for two weeks.

00:51:53.321 --> 00:51:54.531 line:-3
Why am I telling you this?

00:51:54.656 --> 00:51:57.117 line:-3
- Because I care dammit!

00:51:57.283 --> 00:51:58.284 line:-3
- Jim, there's a leech on your neck.

00:51:58.451 --> 00:51:59.202 line:-2
- Ahh!

00:51:59.285 --> 00:52:00.161 line:-2
Ew, ew!

00:52:00.328 --> 00:52:01.287 line:-1
Leech!

00:52:01.454 --> 00:52:02.789 line:-3
- [Bunny] Hey, are you guys having a water fight?

00:52:02.956 --> 00:52:05.709 line:-3
- No, we're not having a water fight.

00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:14.467 line:-3
That's when I decided to start my own business.

00:52:14.634 --> 00:52:15.635 line:-3
Everybody said I was crazy,

00:52:15.802 --> 00:52:17.345 line:-3
but taking orders from others,

00:52:17.512 --> 00:52:20.181 line:-3
that's just not the way the Jim man is made.

00:52:20.348 --> 00:52:22.183 line:-3
Hey Margo, have some of this. It's great, it's great dip.

00:52:22.350 --> 00:52:23.518 line:-1
It's guacamole.

00:52:23.685 --> 00:52:25.311 line:-2
- Of course it's guacamole!

00:52:25.478 --> 00:52:27.230 line:-3
I'm sick of guacamole!

00:52:27.355 --> 00:52:29.107 line:-3
I'm sick of avocados!

00:52:30.358 --> 00:52:31.443 line:-3
I want meat.

00:52:31.609 --> 00:52:32.485 line:-2
- Ha!

00:52:32.652 --> 00:52:35.238 line:-3
I told you you'd want a Burger King out here.

00:52:35.363 --> 00:52:38.783 line:-3
Or maybe a nice juicy steak or meatloaf of...

00:52:40.326 --> 00:52:41.578 line:-3
Quit looking at me like that.

00:52:41.703 --> 00:52:44.456 line:-2
(tense music)

00:52:44.622 --> 00:52:45.373 line:-1
Hey.

00:52:46.666 --> 00:52:49.336 line:-3
You want to eat me don't you?

00:52:49.502 --> 00:52:50.378 line:-3
- I didn't say that.

00:52:50.545 --> 00:52:51.296 line:-3
- You were thinking it.

00:52:51.379 --> 00:52:52.464 line:-3
I can see that look in your eye.

00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:54.632 line:-3
You wanna eat me!

00:52:54.799 --> 00:52:55.633 line:-3
- Only for a minute.

00:52:57.719 --> 00:52:59.429 line:-3
- Moderate feminist.

00:52:59.596 --> 00:53:01.389 line:-3
You women's libbers are all alike.

00:53:01.556 --> 00:53:02.599 line:-3
A couple of days out here in the jungle

00:53:02.724 --> 00:53:04.476 line:-3
and you turn into savages.

00:53:04.642 --> 00:53:06.269 line:-3
You threw away all that rhetoric about equality

00:53:06.436 --> 00:53:08.104 line:-3
and you get down to what you really want.

00:53:08.271 --> 00:53:10.357 line:-3
The domination and consumption of men.

00:53:10.523 --> 00:53:11.775 line:-2
- I'm sorry!

00:53:11.941 --> 00:53:16.821 line:-3
I'm hot, and I'm tired, and I lost my head for a moment!

00:53:19.532 --> 00:53:21.618 line:-3
- Or maybe you found your true self.

00:53:21.743 --> 00:53:23.411 line:-3
Take a look at her, Bunny.

00:53:23.578 --> 00:53:24.704 line:-3
Take a good hard look.

00:53:25.747 --> 00:53:27.207 line:-3
She wants to eat me.

00:53:28.291 --> 00:53:29.584 line:-3
See for yourself what the women's movement

00:53:29.751 --> 00:53:30.627 line:-3
is really all about.

00:53:33.546 --> 00:53:34.422 line:-3
- That's it!

00:53:35.548 --> 00:53:36.800 line:-3
You're dead meat!

00:53:36.966 --> 00:53:38.385 line:-3
- No no, no no!

00:53:38.551 --> 00:53:39.302 line:-1
Bunny!

00:53:39.469 --> 00:53:40.345 line:-1
Help!

00:53:40.512 --> 00:53:41.262 line:-3
Hey honey, chill.

00:53:41.346 --> 00:53:42.305 line:-2
Chill, really.

00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:43.390 line:-3
Come on, we'll get you some nice Donnahew meat.

00:53:43.556 --> 00:53:45.809 line:-3
I'm sure they'd be pleased to be eaten by you.

00:53:45.975 --> 00:53:46.976 line:-3
- Chauvinistic pig!

00:53:47.143 --> 00:53:50.355 line:-3
Let's see what you look like when you're real lean!

00:53:50.522 --> 00:53:52.357 line:-3
- Don't eat him, Dr. Hunt!

00:53:55.110 --> 00:53:56.611 line:-3
- Oh my god.

00:53:56.778 --> 00:53:57.821 line:-3
I'm losing my mind.

00:53:58.905 --> 00:53:59.698 line:-3
It's this jungle.

00:54:01.032 --> 00:54:02.867 line:-3
I'm just losing my mind.

00:54:03.034 --> 00:54:05.370 line:-2
- Well with having your period and everything.

00:54:07.956 --> 00:54:09.416 line:-3
- We've gotta go back.

00:54:09.582 --> 00:54:10.875 line:-3
We're going back.

00:54:11.042 --> 00:54:15.338 line:-3
We've just gone too deep into the heart of the jungle.

00:54:15.505 --> 00:54:16.339 line:-3
We're going back.

00:54:16.464 --> 00:54:19.300 line:-3
- It's a little too late for that, Margo.

00:54:19.467 --> 00:54:20.385 line:-3
I think they found us.

00:54:21.594 --> 00:54:22.470 line:-3
- [Bunny] Cute outfits.

00:54:22.637 --> 00:54:24.222 line:-3
- [Jim] Maybe.

00:54:24.389 --> 00:54:25.682 line:-3
But they don't look too friendly to me.

00:54:25.849 --> 00:54:27.392 line:-3
- [Margo] Don't worry.

00:54:27.559 --> 00:54:28.435 line:-3
- What do you got?

00:54:28.601 --> 00:54:29.352 line:-1
Grenade?

00:54:29.436 --> 00:54:30.520 line:-1
Gun?

00:54:30.645 --> 00:54:31.896 line:-3
- No, something all feminist cultures will understand

00:54:32.063 --> 00:54:34.232 line:-3
no matter how radical or how primitive.

00:54:35.442 --> 00:54:36.735 line:-3
My N.O.W. membership card.

00:54:39.112 --> 00:54:41.489 line:-3
(speaking foreign language)

00:54:41.656 --> 00:54:42.782 line:-3
- What did she say?

00:54:42.949 --> 00:54:43.950 line:-3
- I'm not sure.

00:54:44.117 --> 00:54:45.785 line:-2
It's a strange difficult language.

00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:49.205 line:-1
Listen.

00:54:49.330 --> 00:54:50.665 line:-3
I'm looking for Dr. Kurtz.

00:54:50.832 --> 00:54:52.250 line:-3
Do you understand me?

00:54:52.417 --> 00:54:53.585 line:-2
Dr. Kurtz.

00:54:53.752 --> 00:54:54.919 line:-2
- Kurtz?

00:54:55.086 --> 00:54:55.879 line:-3
- Yes, Dr. Kurtz!

00:54:56.004 --> 00:54:57.339 line:-3
Can you take me to her?

00:54:58.840 --> 00:54:59.924 line:-3
Get your stuff.

00:55:01.051 --> 00:55:03.762 line:-1
(orchestra music)

00:55:09.684 --> 00:55:12.896 line:-3
The secret temple of the Piranha Women.

00:55:13.063 --> 00:55:15.398 line:-3
Their architecture is surprisingly advanced.

00:55:16.608 --> 00:55:17.776 line:-3
- Looks like a big Lego to me.

00:55:31.956 --> 00:55:33.917 line:-3
- This must be the alter room where they...

00:55:34.084 --> 00:55:35.502 line:-2
- Eat guys?

00:55:35.669 --> 00:55:36.419 line:-2
- Yeah.

00:55:43.468 --> 00:55:44.260 line:-2
- Hey.

00:55:44.427 --> 00:55:46.596 line:-3
- Look. A vegetable juice spa.

00:55:46.763 --> 00:55:48.431 line:-3
This must be great for the complexion.

00:55:48.556 --> 00:55:49.766 line:-2
- Jim don't!

00:55:49.933 --> 00:55:50.934 line:-2
- What?

00:55:51.101 --> 00:55:52.477 line:-3
- Bunny, hand me one of those Fritos.

00:56:00.735 --> 00:56:01.820 line:-1
- What is it?

00:56:01.986 --> 00:56:02.821 line:-1
- Piranha.

00:56:02.987 --> 00:56:03.947 line:-1
The real thing.

00:56:04.072 --> 00:56:04.989 line:-3
This must be where the Piranha Women dispose

00:56:05.156 --> 00:56:07.992 line:-3
of the fat and bones of their male sacrifices.

00:56:08.159 --> 00:56:09.411 line:-3
- Very good, Dr. Hunt.

00:56:09.577 --> 00:56:11.287 line:-3
That is quite correct.

00:56:11.454 --> 00:56:12.497 line:-3
- Francine Kurtz.

00:56:12.664 --> 00:56:13.581 line:-3
Then you are alive.

00:56:13.748 --> 00:56:15.792 line:-3
- And she's got one of those cute outfits on.

00:56:15.959 --> 00:56:18.003 line:-3
- I have more than just the outfit, Bunny.

00:56:19.504 --> 00:56:20.422 line:-3
The Piranha Women have christened me

00:56:20.588 --> 00:56:22.549 line:-3
Empress of The Avocado Jungle.

00:56:22.716 --> 00:56:24.426 line:-3
I am their supreme ruler.

00:56:24.592 --> 00:56:25.468 line:-2
- Empress?

00:56:26.636 --> 00:56:29.472 line:-3
- I knew the Avocado Board would send someone after me.

00:56:29.639 --> 00:56:32.475 line:-3
But I never suspected it would be another feminist.

00:56:32.642 --> 00:56:33.727 line:-3
After I did away with the army.

00:56:33.893 --> 00:56:34.978 line:-3
- [Margo] You mean to say you led those

00:56:35.145 --> 00:56:36.855 line:-2
Piranha Women against the soldiers?

00:56:37.022 --> 00:56:38.314 line:-1
- Of course.

00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:40.316 line:-2
They violated our jungle sanctuary.

00:56:40.483 --> 00:56:41.317 line:-2
They had to die.

00:56:42.610 --> 00:56:44.404 line:-2
They were pretty delicious too.

00:56:44.571 --> 00:56:47.490 line:-3
- Dr. Kurtz, I'm unfamiliar with the academic guidelines

00:56:47.615 --> 00:56:49.868 line:-3
at Radcliffe, but I would think any major university

00:56:50.035 --> 00:56:51.119 line:-3
would consider warring on the United States

00:56:51.286 --> 00:56:54.497 line:-3
and eating prisoners of war a serious breach of ethics.

00:56:54.664 --> 00:56:56.875 line:-3
- Always the cautious scholar, huh Dr. Hunt?

00:56:57.917 --> 00:57:00.003 line:-3
I'm not here to study the Piranha Women.

00:57:00.170 --> 00:57:01.629 line:-3
I'm here to lead them.

00:57:01.796 --> 00:57:04.299 line:-3
The future of feminism lies in this temple.

00:57:05.467 --> 00:57:07.469 line:-3
- You're saying the future of women is in cannibalism?

00:57:07.635 --> 00:57:08.678 line:-3
- Face up to the truth!

00:57:08.845 --> 00:57:10.388 line:-3
This is a war!

00:57:10.555 --> 00:57:12.432 line:-3
A war between men and women.

00:57:12.599 --> 00:57:13.516 line:-3
Anything short of cannibalism

00:57:13.641 --> 00:57:15.352 line:-3
is just beating around the bush.

00:57:15.477 --> 00:57:17.520 line:-3
- Well it's obvious the Avocado Board sent the wrong

00:57:17.645 --> 00:57:19.606 line:-3
scholar to deal with the Piranha Women.

00:57:19.773 --> 00:57:22.484 line:-3
- And you're so obviously the right one.

00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:26.529 line:-3
An academic so naive, so trusting, she actually

00:57:26.654 --> 00:57:28.907 line:-2
believes there's an avocado shortage.

00:57:30.075 --> 00:57:31.117 line:-1
Yes.

00:57:31.284 --> 00:57:32.869 line:-2
That's what they told me too.

00:57:32.994 --> 00:57:34.120 line:-2
But I was suspicious enough to do

00:57:34.287 --> 00:57:36.498 line:-2
a little research into the matter.

00:57:36.664 --> 00:57:38.458 line:-3
The fact of the matter is the United States

00:57:38.625 --> 00:57:40.794 line:-2
has a massive avocado glut.

00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:42.504 line:-3
They're dumping avocados by the ton

00:57:42.671 --> 00:57:44.714 line:-3
in the Santa Monica Harbor just to get rid of them.

00:57:44.881 --> 00:57:47.050 line:-3
- But if that's the case, then why send me?

00:57:47.175 --> 00:57:48.551 line:-2
- You're an ethnohistorian.

00:57:48.718 --> 00:57:50.095 line:-2
Use your head.

00:57:50.261 --> 00:57:53.515 line:-3
It's not the avocados the government is worried about.

00:57:53.682 --> 00:57:55.058 line:-3
It's the Piranha Women.

00:57:55.225 --> 00:57:58.144 line:-3
The reactionary male factions are terrified of them.

00:57:58.311 --> 00:58:00.814 line:-3
Terrified of the example a nation of strong women

00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:02.774 line:-3
might set for the rest of the country.

00:58:03.942 --> 00:58:06.903 line:-2
After they succeeded in stopping the ERA,

00:58:07.028 --> 00:58:09.948 line:-3
in the wake of a mainstream feminist backlash,

00:58:10.115 --> 00:58:11.491 line:-3
they figured it was the perfect time

00:58:11.658 --> 00:58:13.493 line:-3
to wipe out the Piranha Women for good.

00:58:14.744 --> 00:58:16.871 line:-3
- But the reservations in Malibu.

00:58:17.038 --> 00:58:18.581 line:-3
- They're there all right.

00:58:18.748 --> 00:58:20.792 line:-2
I did some research into those too.

00:58:20.959 --> 00:58:23.003 line:-2
Deluxe condominiums.

00:58:23.169 --> 00:58:24.004 line:-1
Pool.

00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:25.046 line:-1
Sauna.

00:58:25.213 --> 00:58:26.631 line:-3
Total luxury living.

00:58:27.674 --> 00:58:29.759 line:-3
Only what they didn't tell you about

00:58:29.884 --> 00:58:31.428 line:-3
were the thousand of subscriptions

00:58:31.594 --> 00:58:33.596 line:-3
to Cosmopolitan that were timed for delivery

00:58:33.722 --> 00:58:35.974 line:-2
when the Piranha Women took up residence.

00:58:36.141 --> 00:58:38.101 line:-3
Not to mention the team of Mary Kay cosmetics

00:58:38.226 --> 00:58:41.104 line:-3
saleswomen who were ready to pounce upon them.

00:58:41.271 --> 00:58:43.440 line:-3
They had a secret plan for doing away

00:58:43.565 --> 00:58:44.774 line:-3
with the Piranha Women.

00:58:44.899 --> 00:58:46.609 line:-3
Something far more sinister

00:58:46.735 --> 00:58:48.528 line:-2
than an armored division of infantry.

00:58:49.654 --> 00:58:51.448 line:-2
- Cultural assimilation.

00:58:51.614 --> 00:58:52.907 line:-2
- Yes.

00:58:53.074 --> 00:58:55.452 line:-3
Within five years, the Piranha Women would've been

00:58:55.618 --> 00:58:57.537 line:-3
just a bunch of bikini bunnies bouncing around

00:58:57.704 --> 00:59:00.457 line:-3
Malibu searching for a good sushi bar.

00:59:00.623 --> 00:59:01.499 line:-3
- I know a great sushi bar in Malibu.

00:59:01.666 --> 00:59:03.501 line:-3
You go down Sunset, turn right at PCH and-

00:59:03.668 --> 00:59:04.919 line:-3
- You see?

00:59:05.086 --> 00:59:06.546 line:-3
They would've all ended up...

00:59:07.797 --> 00:59:08.548 line:-2
Like her.

00:59:11.926 --> 00:59:14.637 line:-3
Now that you're here you have only one choice.

00:59:14.804 --> 00:59:15.972 line:-3
To join with us.

00:59:16.097 --> 00:59:17.724 line:-3
Become a Piranha Woman.

00:59:18.767 --> 00:59:20.643 line:-3
- I can't do that.

00:59:20.810 --> 00:59:22.729 line:-3
Although I'm discouraged, I can't give up hope

00:59:22.896 --> 00:59:25.482 line:-3
that there will be equality between the sexes.

00:59:25.607 --> 00:59:26.900 line:-3
- I cannot allow you to leave the jungle

00:59:27.067 --> 00:59:29.611 line:-2
and reveal the secrets of the Piranha Women.

00:59:29.778 --> 00:59:32.614 line:-3
You either join us or you all die together.

00:59:33.823 --> 00:59:34.991 line:-3
- Then kill us.

00:59:35.116 --> 00:59:38.703 line:-3
Because I'd rather die than compromise my ethical standards.

00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:40.663 line:-3
- Hey hey hey, speak for yourself!

00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:43.208 line:-3
I'm sure could roundtable this whole thing and come up-

00:59:45.210 --> 00:59:47.754 line:-3
- You, idiot male, will die anyway.

00:59:47.921 --> 00:59:49.130 line:-3
You look a little tough, but I suppose

00:59:49.297 --> 00:59:51.591 line:-2
if you were marinated before cooking...

00:59:51.758 --> 00:59:52.801 line:-2
Take him.

00:59:52.967 --> 00:59:54.344 line:-3
- Marinated? Sweetie, that's carcinogenic.

00:59:54.427 --> 00:59:56.179 line:-2
You don't want to, Bunny!

00:59:56.346 --> 00:59:57.097 line:-1
- Jim!

00:59:57.222 --> 00:59:58.014 line:-1
(suspense music)

00:59:58.139 --> 00:59:58.932 line:-3
Get off me!

00:59:59.099 --> 01:00:00.517 line:-3
- Take Dr. Hunt also.

01:00:03.144 --> 01:00:05.772 line:-2
(bones cracking)

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:12.821 line:-3
You're outnumbered, Margo.

01:00:12.987 --> 01:00:14.698 line:-3
There are a thousand Piranha Women in this temple.

01:00:14.864 --> 01:00:16.533 line:-3
You haven't got a chance.

01:00:16.658 --> 01:00:19.536 line:-3
- You let my friends go or I'll shoot you first.

01:00:19.661 --> 01:00:20.704 line:-2
- Go ahead.

01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:22.872 line:-3
Fire on a fellow feminist.

01:00:23.039 --> 01:00:25.125 line:-3
Fire on a fellow anthropologist.

01:00:26.251 --> 01:00:27.836 line:-3
You may not personally agree with my tactics,

01:00:28.003 --> 01:00:29.713 line:-3
but you know my only goal is to help

01:00:29.838 --> 01:00:32.090 line:-3
the Piranha Women maintain their cultural heritage.

01:00:34.759 --> 01:00:35.927 line:-3
Go ahead and shoot.

01:00:36.094 --> 01:00:36.886 line:-3
- Shoot her!

01:00:37.012 --> 01:00:39.180 line:-3
Do it! Give the woman what she wants!

01:00:44.352 --> 01:00:46.187 line:-3
- It will take some time to make the preparations

01:00:46.354 --> 01:00:49.357 line:-3
for your initiation into the tribe of Piranha Women.

01:00:49.524 --> 01:00:50.775 line:-2
I will give you until tomorrow morning

01:00:50.942 --> 01:00:51.693 line:-2
to make your decision.

01:00:53.278 --> 01:00:56.573 line:-3
If you agree to join us, you will sacrifice your first man.

01:00:57.866 --> 01:00:59.617 line:-3
If you do not agree, you will be thrown

01:00:59.784 --> 01:01:01.953 line:-3
into the piranha pit and you will die.

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:02.871 line:-1
Painfully.

01:01:04.873 --> 01:01:05.623 line:-2
Take her.

01:01:07.876 --> 01:01:09.085 line:-3
Take the airhead too.

01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:10.920 line:-3
- [Bunny] Jim!

01:01:11.046 --> 01:01:11.796 line:-3
- Bunny don't worry!

01:01:11.963 --> 01:01:12.964 line:-3
You'll save me!

01:01:17.719 --> 01:01:18.762 line:-1
Hi.

01:01:18.887 --> 01:01:20.013 line:-3
Hey, I hope you know that crack

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:21.848 line:-3
about shooting you was just a joke.

01:01:22.015 --> 01:01:23.350 line:-3
That's me, always with the...

01:01:23.516 --> 01:01:25.810 line:-3
Nonstop, the whole trip I'm...

01:01:25.977 --> 01:01:27.812 line:-3
Have they told you how great you look in that dress?

01:01:27.979 --> 01:01:29.647 line:-3
Because that, see, it's feminine

01:01:29.814 --> 01:01:32.776 line:-3
and feminist which is my cause.

01:01:32.901 --> 01:01:35.612 line:-3
Really, feminism. I thought Geraldine Ferraro,

01:01:35.779 --> 01:01:37.864 line:-3
for example, creamed Bush in that debate.

01:01:38.031 --> 01:01:39.908 line:-3
- [Kurtz] You're gonna cook up real good.

01:01:40.658 --> 01:01:42.827 line:-3
Put him with the rest of the men.

01:01:42.994 --> 01:01:43.995 line:-3
Tomorrow we eat him.

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:47.248 line:-3
- You know, I've got a subscription to Men!

01:01:50.001 --> 01:01:51.753 line:-3
Throwing me in with your lunch meat, huh?

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:55.131 line:-3
Those guys must be bigger wimps than the Donnahews.

01:01:56.341 --> 01:01:57.884 line:-3
All right, I'm going, whoa!

01:01:58.051 --> 01:01:59.302 line:-3
Can I interject one thing?

01:02:00.428 --> 01:02:02.847 line:-3
Now I'm not saying this just to save my hide.

01:02:03.014 --> 01:02:05.642 line:-3
But talking strictly nutritional requirements,

01:02:05.767 --> 01:02:07.686 line:-3
if you girls are eating only men you cannot

01:02:07.852 --> 01:02:08.978 line:-3
possibly be getting everything you need

01:02:09.104 --> 01:02:10.980 line:-3
from the four basic food groups!

01:02:11.147 --> 01:02:13.358 line:-2
(loud thud)

01:02:16.486 --> 01:02:20.156 line:-3
Gee, you guys are pretty big for wimps.

01:02:20.323 --> 01:02:22.992 line:-3
Of course, the joke's on you when those

01:02:23.118 --> 01:02:24.828 line:-3
broads come back and start picking out

01:02:24.994 --> 01:02:26.830 line:-3
ingredients for chicken McMacho.

01:02:30.208 --> 01:02:31.084 line:-3
Anybody got a smoke?

01:02:37.257 --> 01:02:39.175 line:-3
- I brought you some food.

01:02:39.342 --> 01:02:41.094 line:-3
- Who are you?

01:02:41.261 --> 01:02:42.679 line:-3
- I am Jean -Pierre.

01:02:42.846 --> 01:02:44.222 line:-3
Your sacrifice for tomorrow.

01:02:45.974 --> 01:02:48.226 line:-3
It is traditional in the tribe of the Piranha Women

01:02:48.393 --> 01:02:50.854 line:-3
for the sacrificee to serve his mistress

01:02:51.021 --> 01:02:52.939 line:-3
the night before the ceremony.

01:02:54.024 --> 01:02:55.442 line:-3
- But you speak English.

01:02:55.608 --> 01:02:56.484 line:-2
- Some.

01:02:56.651 --> 01:02:58.862 line:-3
I learned it from listening to Dr. Kurtz.

01:03:00.447 --> 01:03:01.906 line:-3
- Well you must be very smart to have picked it up

01:03:02.073 --> 01:03:04.826 line:-3
so quickly without any formal training.

01:03:04.993 --> 01:03:06.911 line:-3
- Alas, intelligence in males

01:03:07.078 --> 01:03:08.913 line:-3
is not valued by the Piranha Women.

01:03:09.956 --> 01:03:10.957 line:-3
Only muscle tissue.

01:03:12.125 --> 01:03:15.211 line:-3
- Well you certainly have plenty of that.

01:03:15.378 --> 01:03:17.005 line:-3
- They force us to work out with weights.

01:03:17.172 --> 01:03:18.965 line:-2
It makes the meat more flavorful.

01:03:19.132 --> 01:03:20.091 line:-1
Please, eat.

01:03:20.258 --> 01:03:21.009 line:-3
- Oh thank you.

01:03:21.092 --> 01:03:22.010 line:-2
I am hungry.

01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:29.976 line:-2
Very good.

01:03:30.143 --> 01:03:30.935 line:-2
- I'm glad.

01:03:31.102 --> 01:03:32.729 line:-3
He was a friend of mine.

01:03:32.896 --> 01:03:34.189 line:-1
Jacques.

01:03:34.356 --> 01:03:35.857 line:-3
- Gosh, this stuff is really good.

01:03:36.024 --> 01:03:37.067 line:-3
Chewy, but tasty.

01:03:37.192 --> 01:03:38.860 line:-3
Kinda like lean pork.

01:03:39.027 --> 01:03:39.944 line:-3
What is it?

01:03:40.111 --> 01:03:40.945 line:-2
- Jacques.

01:03:41.112 --> 01:03:43.365 line:-3
- Is that one of those beef substitutes?

01:03:43.531 --> 01:03:44.741 line:-1
Huh?

01:03:44.866 --> 01:03:46.159 line:-3
Whatever it is, it sure is good.

01:03:47.035 --> 01:03:48.453 line:-3
You work out on a Nautilus?

01:03:49.996 --> 01:03:51.748 line:-3
Got any more dip?

01:03:51.873 --> 01:03:54.084 line:-2
(tense music)

01:04:22.028 --> 01:04:25.365 line:-3
(speaking foreign language)

01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:39.087 line:-3
- I'd like to speak to Jean -Pierre.

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:41.339 line:-3
Where is Jean -Pierre?

01:04:45.385 --> 01:04:47.846 line:-3
Oh, he's a friend of yours huh?

01:04:48.013 --> 01:04:50.015 line:-3
Well don't worry, I won't kill him.

01:04:50.181 --> 01:04:51.141 line:-3
God knows I won't eat him.

01:05:12.037 --> 01:05:13.997 line:-3
- There is your sacrifice.

01:05:14.122 --> 01:05:15.498 line:-3
If you wish to become a Piranha Woman you must

01:05:15.623 --> 01:05:19.044 line:-3
first take his body, and then his life.

01:05:19.210 --> 01:05:20.879 line:-3
What is your decision?

01:05:21.046 --> 01:05:23.840 line:-3
- I refuse to kill another human being in cold blood.

01:05:24.966 --> 01:05:27.927 line:-3
However, in deference to your cultural traditions,

01:05:28.094 --> 01:05:29.429 line:-3
I would be willing to have sex with him.

01:05:29.596 --> 01:05:30.889 line:-3
- Forget it.

01:05:31.056 --> 01:05:32.932 line:-3
If you want your cake you'll have to eat it.

01:05:33.099 --> 01:05:34.893 line:-3
If you do not use this dagger to draw his blood

01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:36.936 line:-2
I will have you thrown into the piranha pit.

01:05:37.103 --> 01:05:39.022 line:-2
- I won't join your tribe.

01:05:39.147 --> 01:05:40.523 line:-3
And I appeal to you as a member

01:05:40.648 --> 01:05:43.026 line:-3
of the National Academy of Sciences to release me

01:05:43.151 --> 01:05:45.362 line:-3
and my friends and allow us to go on our way.

01:05:45.487 --> 01:05:46.613 line:-2
- No!

01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:48.573 line:-3
I want to be a Piranha Woman.

01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:50.033 line:-3
- Bunny, what are you saying?

01:05:50.158 --> 01:05:52.118 line:-3
- I wanna be a Piranha Woman.

01:05:52.285 --> 01:05:53.203 line:-3
- Bunny, dammit, I knew I shouldn't have brought you.

01:05:53.370 --> 01:05:56.122 line:-3
You haven't had enough women's studies core classes.

01:05:56.289 --> 01:05:57.957 line:-3
You're being seduced by the simplicity

01:05:58.124 --> 01:05:59.376 line:-2
of the Piranha Women's philosophy.

01:05:59.501 --> 01:06:00.585 line:-2
- No I haven't.

01:06:00.752 --> 01:06:02.962 line:-3
I just want one of those cute outfits.

01:06:03.129 --> 01:06:04.047 line:-3
- [Margo] Bunny, listen to me!

01:06:04.214 --> 01:06:05.131 line:-3
- Silence her!

01:06:08.301 --> 01:06:10.470 line:-3
Are you sure you wanna become a Piranha Woman?

01:06:10.637 --> 01:06:12.097 line:-2
- Yes.

01:06:12.263 --> 01:06:13.056 line:-3
- Are you willing to partake

01:06:13.181 --> 01:06:15.433 line:-2
in the blood sacrifice initiation?

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:16.601 line:-3
- Well if you mean with sex

01:06:16.768 --> 01:06:17.894 line:-3
with a guy and then kill him, sure.

01:06:18.019 --> 01:06:18.853 line:-3
I'll try it.

01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:21.106 line:-3
I've done weirder things at frat parties.

01:06:21.272 --> 01:06:23.858 line:-3
- Then I will allow you to become a Piranha Woman.

01:06:24.776 --> 01:06:25.985 line:-2
On one condition.

01:06:29.531 --> 01:06:31.199 line:-3
He shall be your sacrifice.

01:06:33.034 --> 01:06:36.079 line:-3
- Well now you've gone too far, Dr. Kurtz.

01:06:36.246 --> 01:06:38.289 line:-3
I happen to be a pretty good judge

01:06:38.456 --> 01:06:40.917 line:-3
of human nature, and as far as our Bunny goes,

01:06:41.084 --> 01:06:43.545 line:-3
well the poor kid happens to be nuts about me.

01:06:43.712 --> 01:06:44.462 line:-3
She would never-

01:06:44.546 --> 01:06:46.089 line:-3
- [Bunny] Sure, I'll kill him.

01:06:46.256 --> 01:06:48.925 line:-3
- Prepare them both for sacrifice.

01:06:49.092 --> 01:06:50.301 line:-3
- [Bunny] Toodles!

01:06:54.305 --> 01:06:55.056 line:-2
- What?

01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:56.516 line:-1
- Just do it!

01:06:56.683 --> 01:06:57.434 line:-1
- Rawr!

01:06:58.393 --> 01:06:59.686 line:-2
- [Kurtz] The sacrifice has escaped!

01:06:59.853 --> 01:07:02.522 line:-2
Kill him!

01:07:02.689 --> 01:07:04.107 line:-3
- Quick, this way!

01:07:04.232 --> 01:07:05.066 line:-3
- [Kurtz] Stop them!

01:07:05.233 --> 01:07:08.403 line:-2
Kill them! (suspense music)

01:07:09.738 --> 01:07:11.072 line:-1
- Over the ledge.

01:07:11.239 --> 01:07:11.990 line:-1
Jump!

01:07:12.073 --> 01:07:13.241 line:-3
I can fight them off from here.

01:07:13.408 --> 01:07:15.160 line:-3
- Oh no, you're coming with me.

01:07:15.326 --> 01:07:17.203 line:-3
- No, it's more important that you escape.

01:07:17.370 --> 01:07:20.165 line:-3
- Jean-Pierre, will you stop being a sacrifice?

01:07:20.331 --> 01:07:21.082 line:-1
Now come with me.

01:07:27.255 --> 01:07:28.006 line:-1
Ahh!

01:07:31.343 --> 01:07:32.260 line:-2
Jean -Pierre!

01:07:32.427 --> 01:07:33.303 line:-2
Jean -Pierre!

01:07:34.554 --> 01:07:36.181 line:-2
Jean -Pierre.

01:07:36.348 --> 01:07:37.974 line:-3
Dammit, the first decent guy I...

01:07:39.601 --> 01:07:42.270 line:-1
(suspense music)

01:08:11.299 --> 01:08:13.718 line:-1
(dramatic music)

01:08:29.651 --> 01:08:32.529 line:-3
- So this is why Piranha Women have red hair huh?

01:08:32.654 --> 01:08:33.405 line:-1
Huh?

01:08:35.198 --> 01:08:36.449 line:-3
Gee, I hope this dye isn't gonna make my hair frizz.

01:08:36.616 --> 01:08:39.160 line:-2
Do you have any conditioner for that?

01:08:39.327 --> 01:08:40.120 line:-3
You know, actually, I was thinking maybe

01:08:40.286 --> 01:08:41.079 line:-3
we could go a little shorter this time

01:08:41.246 --> 01:08:43.123 line:-3
in the cut if that's okay with you.

01:08:43.289 --> 01:08:45.125 line:-3
Or maybe, if we keep it red, I should just

01:08:45.291 --> 01:08:46.584 line:-3
keep it long because then I'll look like Tiffany,

01:08:46.751 --> 01:08:49.337 line:-3
and actually I thinking about taking up singing, so...

01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:02.225 line:-2
- Hey.

01:09:02.350 --> 01:09:03.727 line:-3
Have I told you girls how terrific you look?

01:09:03.893 --> 01:09:04.769 line:-2
Great loins.

01:09:06.187 --> 01:09:07.188 line:-3
Hey, what are you doing?

01:09:07.355 --> 01:09:08.523 line:-3
Hey wait, whoa whoa whoa, can I say one thing?

01:09:08.690 --> 01:09:10.233 line:-2
One thing.

01:09:10.358 --> 01:09:12.527 line:-3
I'd rather have you kill me than make me a gelding.

01:09:12.694 --> 01:09:13.820 line:-3
We had a dog once and we fixed him

01:09:13.987 --> 01:09:15.613 line:-3
and he was just never happy.

01:09:17.699 --> 01:09:19.325 line:-3
Hey, can't we be reasonable about this?

01:09:19.492 --> 01:09:21.244 line:-3
I mean we're all people here.

01:09:21.411 --> 01:09:23.079 line:-3
Piranhas, non -Piranhas.

01:09:24.372 --> 01:09:25.373 line:-3
Hey, what's this?

01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:27.542 line:-3
A little hot tub action, huh?

01:09:28.835 --> 01:09:31.212 line:-3
Maybe I misjudged you girls.

01:09:31.379 --> 01:09:33.298 line:-3
I think I might actually like this place.

01:09:34.632 --> 01:09:35.383 line:-2
Oh yeah.

01:09:36.926 --> 01:09:37.802 line:-1
That's nice.

01:09:38.970 --> 01:09:42.390 line:-3
Hey, you know, you're not such bad young ladies after all.

01:09:42.557 --> 01:09:44.684 line:-2
Probably just had rough childhoods, right?

01:09:44.851 --> 01:09:46.102 line:-3
Smoked a lot of pot in high school,

01:09:46.269 --> 01:09:48.229 line:-3
parents were divorced, that kind of thing?

01:09:49.397 --> 01:09:50.732 line:-3
Oh yeah, oh that's good.

01:09:50.899 --> 01:09:51.649 line:-1
A little lower.

01:09:51.733 --> 01:09:53.318 line:-1
Little lower.

01:09:53.485 --> 01:09:54.778 line:-2
That's the spot.

01:09:54.944 --> 01:09:56.112 line:-2
Now make circles.

01:09:56.279 --> 01:09:57.405 line:-1
(Jim chuckles)

01:09:57.572 --> 01:09:58.323 line:-2
Just kidding.

01:09:59.574 --> 01:10:01.368 line:-3
Boy, it's nice to see at least a couple of you girls

01:10:01.534 --> 01:10:03.411 line:-3
know how to treat a man around this crazy temple.

01:10:04.746 --> 01:10:05.622 line:-2
You know, a lot of you Piranha gals,

01:10:05.747 --> 01:10:08.083 line:-3
you probably just never met the right guy.

01:10:09.334 --> 01:10:10.460 line:-3
And I bet you you're terrific cooks.

01:10:10.627 --> 01:10:12.837 line:-2
Something around here smells fabulous.

01:10:14.589 --> 01:10:16.424 line:-2
I think it's this bath water.

01:10:16.591 --> 01:10:18.760 line:-2
This would make a hearty soup base wouldn't it?

01:10:22.514 --> 01:10:23.390 line:-1
Hey.

01:10:23.556 --> 01:10:24.683 line:-3
What's up, doc?

01:10:25.684 --> 01:10:26.518 line:-2
What goes...

01:10:27.769 --> 01:10:29.312 line:-2
Hey, what...

01:10:29.479 --> 01:10:31.606 line:-3
Oh my god, you're marinating me!

01:10:31.773 --> 01:10:32.524 line:-1
Hey!

01:10:32.607 --> 01:10:33.358 line:-3
Let me out!

01:10:41.908 --> 01:10:43.743 line:-3
- We are the Barracuda Women.

01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:46.371 line:-3
We are the sworn enemies of the Piranha Women.

01:10:46.538 --> 01:10:49.374 line:-3
If you were escaping from them, you must be our friend.

01:10:56.631 --> 01:10:58.675 line:-3
Thousands of years ago, the Piranha Women

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:01.261 line:-3
and Barracuda Women were as one.

01:11:01.428 --> 01:11:04.764 line:-3
But we split over ideological differences.

01:11:04.931 --> 01:11:05.682 line:-3
- What were they?

01:11:07.308 --> 01:11:08.935 line:-3
- The Piranha Women believe that men should be

01:11:09.102 --> 01:11:11.521 line:-3
slaughtered and eaten with guacamole dip.

01:11:12.313 --> 01:11:13.940 line:-3
- And you think that's wrong?

01:11:14.107 --> 01:11:15.025 line:-2
- Yes!

01:11:15.191 --> 01:11:17.902 line:-3
We believe they should be eaten with clam dip.

01:11:18.987 --> 01:11:20.405 line:-3
- That's it?

01:11:20.572 --> 01:11:21.322 line:-2
Clam dip?

01:11:21.406 --> 01:11:23.450 line:-3
- It's a fundamental principle.

01:11:23.616 --> 01:11:24.492 line:-3
- You people have been divided

01:11:24.659 --> 01:11:26.828 line:-3
for thousands of years because of a kind of dip?

01:11:28.371 --> 01:11:30.206 line:-3
Oh that really makes me mad.

01:11:30.373 --> 01:11:32.709 line:-3
Why is it women always argue over such petty differences?

01:11:32.876 --> 01:11:34.919 line:-3
It's not wonder we couldn't get the ERA passed.

01:11:35.086 --> 01:11:37.797 line:-3
Men can always seem to agree on football and beer.

01:11:39.591 --> 01:11:40.342 line:-3
Well that's it.

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:44.387 line:-3
We are going back to the Piranha Women's temple.

01:11:44.554 --> 01:11:46.723 line:-3
The women of this jungle must unite.

01:11:46.890 --> 01:11:48.266 line:-3
And I'm gonna settle a score

01:11:48.433 --> 01:11:50.393 line:-2
with a certain renegade ethnographer.

01:12:03.782 --> 01:12:07.452 line:-3
- I think I'm gonna like being a Piranha Woman.

01:12:10.497 --> 01:12:12.582 line:-3
- What you do is you set up a joint committee

01:12:12.707 --> 01:12:14.793 line:-3
consisting of equal numbers of Piranha Women

01:12:14.959 --> 01:12:17.504 line:-3
and Barracuda Women, you meet biweekly,

01:12:17.671 --> 01:12:19.881 line:-2
air any differences that might arise,

01:12:20.048 --> 01:12:22.342 line:-3
and it's really that simple.

01:12:22.509 --> 01:12:24.427 line:-3
So what we'll do is we'll organize...

01:12:24.594 --> 01:12:26.805 line:-2
(tense music)

01:12:37.649 --> 01:12:40.985 line:-3
(speaking foreign language)

01:13:08.221 --> 01:13:09.431 line:-3
- Onward, women!

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:16.896 line:-3
(shouting foreign language)

01:13:18.606 --> 01:13:19.858 line:-3
- Come on, move it!

01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:30.410 line:-3
Kurtz's field notes.

01:13:44.632 --> 01:13:46.760 line:-3
It's an outline for a book.

01:13:54.142 --> 01:13:55.477 line:-3
- Okay, let's see.

01:13:55.643 --> 01:13:59.481 line:-3
So she's gonna make love to me, that's good.

01:13:59.647 --> 01:14:02.692 line:-3
Then she's gonna kill me and eat me.

01:14:02.859 --> 01:14:03.777 line:-1
That's bad.

01:14:05.570 --> 01:14:07.572 line:-3
Why can't I ever have a completely good day?

01:14:08.823 --> 01:14:10.158 line:-3
- Here, Bunny.

01:14:10.325 --> 01:14:12.494 line:-3
Drink of the elixir of the Piranha Women.

01:14:21.002 --> 01:14:22.587 line:-3
Let the sacrifice begin!

01:14:31.179 --> 01:14:32.639 line:-3
- Bunny, please!

01:14:32.806 --> 01:14:33.932 line:-3
Put away that knife.

01:14:34.099 --> 01:14:35.600 line:-3
You don't know what you're doing.

01:14:35.767 --> 01:14:38.061 line:-3
This whole crazy jungle's got you all mixed up.

01:14:39.187 --> 01:14:40.563 line:-3
- I know what I'm doing.

01:14:40.730 --> 01:14:43.733 line:-2
I want to become a Piranha Woman.

01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:44.859 line:-3
- Oh my god.

01:14:45.026 --> 01:14:46.528 line:-2
Your eyes.

01:14:46.695 --> 01:14:47.737 line:-3
That strange elixir of the Piranha Women

01:14:47.904 --> 01:14:49.989 line:-3
has changed the color of your eyes.

01:14:50.156 --> 01:14:52.534 line:-3
- No it hasn't. - Green contacts, stupid.

01:14:52.701 --> 01:14:54.452 line:-2
Now shut up while I sacrifice you.

01:14:59.833 --> 01:15:02.168 line:-3
I'm sorry I have to kill you.

01:15:02.335 --> 01:15:05.422 line:-3
I really did think you were kinda cute.

01:15:05.547 --> 01:15:07.716 line:-3
- Bunny, please don't.

01:15:07.882 --> 01:15:08.925 line:-3
Don't kill me.

01:15:10.969 --> 01:15:11.845 line:-3
- I have to.

01:15:14.723 --> 01:15:15.932 line:-3
- What did Margo say?

01:15:18.309 --> 01:15:20.520 line:-3
Oh yeah, the song.

01:15:20.687 --> 01:15:23.148 line:-1
(humming Bolero)

01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:25.025 line:-3
- That song.

01:15:26.693 --> 01:15:27.444 line:-1
Bolero.

01:15:33.241 --> 01:15:33.992 line:-3
- Kill him.

01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:35.910 line:-1
Now!

01:15:39.164 --> 01:15:39.914 line:-2
Kill him!

01:15:41.082 --> 01:15:42.042 line:-2
- I can't!

01:15:42.208 --> 01:15:42.959 line:-3
- Do it!

01:15:47.005 --> 01:15:47.756 line:-2
- I can't.

01:15:49.174 --> 01:15:49.966 line:-3
I love him.

01:16:02.103 --> 01:16:05.065 line:-3
- Throw them both in the piranha pit.

01:16:06.149 --> 01:16:08.651 line:-3
- That water's really gonna stain this outfit.

01:16:08.818 --> 01:16:09.569 line:-2
- Wait!

01:16:11.321 --> 01:16:12.072 line:-3
- What now?

01:16:13.323 --> 01:16:15.658 line:-3
- According to the traditions of the Piranha Women,

01:16:15.825 --> 01:16:17.660 line:-3
I challenge the Empress of The Avocado Jungle

01:16:17.827 --> 01:16:19.704 line:-3
to a battle for the right to the throne.

01:16:21.289 --> 01:16:22.707 line:-3
- It is your right.

01:16:22.874 --> 01:16:26.211 line:-3
But I warn you Margo, you haven't got a chance.

01:16:26.378 --> 01:16:27.128 line:-3
- We'll see.

01:16:30.131 --> 01:16:32.759 line:-1
(suspense music)

01:16:37.806 --> 01:16:40.016 line:-3
- You handle yourself fairly well.

01:16:40.183 --> 01:16:42.769 line:-3
- I studied ancient weaponry at Berkeley.

01:16:42.936 --> 01:16:44.145 line:-3
- Professor Harris?

01:16:44.312 --> 01:16:45.814 line:-3
- No, Professor Johnson.

01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:46.815 line:-2
- Really?

01:16:46.981 --> 01:16:49.609 line:-2
I had Professor Johnson at Stanford.

01:16:49.776 --> 01:16:50.777 line:-2
Enough preliminaries.

01:16:54.155 --> 01:16:55.699 line:-2
- Why don't you tell the Piranha Women

01:16:55.865 --> 01:16:58.076 line:-3
the real reason you became their leader.

01:16:58.243 --> 01:16:59.619 line:-2
- What are you talking about?

01:16:59.786 --> 01:17:00.829 line:-2
- I found your study.

01:17:02.330 --> 01:17:03.790 line:-2
I read your notes.

01:17:03.957 --> 01:17:05.709 line:-2
The outline for your book?

01:17:05.834 --> 01:17:08.086 line:-3
You don't care about the Piranha Women.

01:17:08.253 --> 01:17:10.922 line:-3
You just want to write a book about your experiences.

01:17:11.089 --> 01:17:11.881 line:-3
- That's not true.

01:17:14.009 --> 01:17:16.803 line:-3
- My Life As A Piranha Woman by Francine Kurtz?

01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:18.013 line:-1
Catchy.

01:17:18.179 --> 01:17:19.973 line:-3
Should make the bestseller list.

01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:22.183 line:-3
The media hype from your last book was fading.

01:17:22.350 --> 01:17:23.727 line:-3
You needed something new to get back

01:17:23.893 --> 01:17:25.603 line:-3
on the talk show circuit.

01:17:25.770 --> 01:17:27.564 line:-3
Isn't that right?

01:17:27.689 --> 01:17:28.690 line:-3
Well what better than an expose

01:17:28.857 --> 01:17:31.067 line:-2
on the Piranha Women's lives?

01:17:33.028 --> 01:17:33.903 line:-2
- Think Margo will win?

01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:35.613 line:-2
- Yeah.

01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:38.241 line:-3
Do you have any more of those red licorice ropes?

01:17:38.366 --> 01:17:39.325 line:-3
- Sure, in my backpack.

01:17:39.492 --> 01:17:40.618 line:-1
Why?

01:17:40.785 --> 01:17:42.912 line:-3
- We'll discuss it later.

01:17:43.079 --> 01:17:44.622 line:-3
- You were going to exploit their culture

01:17:44.789 --> 01:17:47.083 line:-3
and traditions for a cheap paperback potboiler.

01:17:48.376 --> 01:17:49.836 line:-3
A kiss, sacrifice, and tell book.

01:17:51.379 --> 01:17:52.714 line:-3
- All right, anybody want any action on Margo?

01:17:52.881 --> 01:17:54.924 line:-3
The point spread is three against Dr. Kurtz.

01:17:55.050 --> 01:17:57.761 line:-2
Huh? Anybody in on this?

01:17:57.886 --> 01:17:58.636 line:-1
- Shh.

01:17:58.762 --> 01:17:59.804 line:-1
- Chicks.

01:17:59.971 --> 01:18:00.930 line:-1
- It's true.

01:18:01.056 --> 01:18:02.724 line:-2
I was planning a book.

01:18:02.891 --> 01:18:04.934 line:-3
But it was going to be a scholarly work.

01:18:05.101 --> 01:18:06.311 line:-2
- Oh hardly, Kurtz.

01:18:06.478 --> 01:18:08.813 line:-2
You've spent too much time in the jungle.

01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:10.899 line:-2
You've become a primitive yourself.

01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:13.151 line:-3
I read your notes.

01:18:13.318 --> 01:18:15.695 line:-3
Your field methodology is sloppy.

01:18:15.862 --> 01:18:17.155 line:-3
Your conclusion's shaky.

01:18:17.322 --> 01:18:18.907 line:-3
Even with sheer hype you couldn't get away

01:18:19.074 --> 01:18:20.992 line:-3
with the generalizations you make in your outline.

01:18:25.497 --> 01:18:28.792 line:-3
You're no better than the chauvinists who sent us here.

01:18:28.917 --> 01:18:29.709 line:-3
You'd exploit the Piranha Women

01:18:29.876 --> 01:18:32.128 line:-2
for your own aggrandizement.

01:18:32.253 --> 01:18:33.755 line:-3
- You don't understand, I had...

01:18:36.549 --> 01:18:39.177 line:-1
(dramatic music)

01:18:41.179 --> 01:18:42.138 line:-3
- Francine, the pool, watch out.

01:18:42.263 --> 01:18:43.098 line:-1
- Stay back!

01:18:46.559 --> 01:18:48.186 line:-1
You don't understand.

01:18:49.521 --> 01:18:50.355 line:-1
I had to do it.

01:18:52.816 --> 01:18:55.151 line:-2
I'd been on the talk show circuit for six months.

01:18:55.276 --> 01:18:56.403 line:-1
The token feminist.

01:18:56.569 --> 01:18:58.863 line:-2
The butt of every bra -burning joke.

01:19:00.573 --> 01:19:01.574 line:-2
You don't know what it's like trying to face

01:19:01.741 --> 01:19:04.661 line:-2
David Letterman with a book on male insensitivity.

01:19:07.330 --> 01:19:08.748 line:-2
I needed something more.

01:19:10.375 --> 01:19:11.876 line:-1
I thought.

01:19:12.043 --> 01:19:13.712 line:-1
Piranha Women.

01:19:13.878 --> 01:19:14.629 line:-1
Cannibalism.

01:19:16.965 --> 01:19:18.800 line:-2
Who could laugh at me then?

01:19:18.967 --> 01:19:20.301 line:-2
- Oh  Francine- - Stay back!

01:19:23.096 --> 01:19:24.055 line:-1
You're right.

01:19:25.348 --> 01:19:26.891 line:-2
I was exploiting the Piranha Women.

01:19:29.019 --> 01:19:31.855 line:-3
You don't know what it was like.

01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:33.898 line:-2
David Letterman.

01:19:34.065 --> 01:19:34.941 line:-1
God!

01:19:36.067 --> 01:19:36.818 line:-2
The horror.

01:19:38.987 --> 01:19:42.282 line:-3
The horror of that show.

01:19:42.449 --> 01:19:43.241 line:-2
The horror.

01:19:44.617 --> 01:19:45.368 line:-2
- Francine!

01:20:07.182 --> 01:20:08.141 line:-3
- You're very wise, Dr. Hunt.

01:20:08.308 --> 01:20:11.728 line:-3
Now all the women of the jungle shall be united.

01:20:11.895 --> 01:20:13.855 line:-3
- Well now that you are united you may want to reconsider

01:20:14.022 --> 01:20:16.733 line:-3
your relationships with the men in your tribe.

01:20:16.858 --> 01:20:18.068 line:-3
There are other ways of relating

01:20:18.193 --> 01:20:20.362 line:-3
to them besides as foodstuffs.

01:20:21.613 --> 01:20:24.115 line:-3
- [Barracuda Leader] We shall consider what you have said

01:20:24.282 --> 01:20:26.993 line:-3
and discuss it at our biweekly committee meetings.

01:20:29.037 --> 01:20:29.996 line:-1
Farewell.

01:20:30.163 --> 01:20:31.456 line:-3
May you make it safely home.

01:20:33.917 --> 01:20:35.001 line:-3
- Bye bye!

01:20:35.168 --> 01:20:36.878 line:-3
- Yeah, keep in touch.

01:20:38.630 --> 01:20:40.298 line:-3
Okay, here you go.

01:20:42.926 --> 01:20:43.802 line:-3
- Where's my gun?

01:20:45.011 --> 01:20:45.762 line:-3
- Oh, the gun.

01:20:47.555 --> 01:20:50.225 line:-3
Hey, let me carry the gun.

01:20:50.392 --> 01:20:52.102 line:-3
Just to the edge of the jungle.

01:20:52.268 --> 01:20:53.937 line:-3
Come on, I mean you drove and everything.

01:20:54.104 --> 01:20:55.063 line:-3
Let me carry the gun.

01:20:56.564 --> 01:20:59.275 line:-3
You know, all the Piranha chicks are watching.

01:20:59.401 --> 01:21:00.360 line:-3
I should carry the gun.

01:21:03.697 --> 01:21:04.447 line:-1
Thanks.

01:21:06.324 --> 01:21:07.450 line:-3
Hey, it's not loaded is it?

01:21:10.954 --> 01:21:12.997 line:-1
(gunshot)

01:21:22.090 --> 01:21:23.967 line:-3
- After the medical check -up with the Valium prescriptions

01:21:24.092 --> 01:21:27.053 line:-3
there'll be tea with Nancy Reagan.

01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:28.972 line:-3
Day two we will start out with a seminar

01:21:29.097 --> 01:21:32.017 line:-3
by Fawn Hall on office relations.

01:21:33.101 --> 01:21:34.227 line:-1
Then.

01:21:34.394 --> 01:21:36.396 line:-3
Then comes the political orientation.

01:21:36.563 --> 01:21:39.983 line:-3
- Yeah, and we got Phyllis Schlafly on standby.

01:21:41.026 --> 01:21:41.776 line:-3
- Hopefully it won't be long before

01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:45.947 line:-3
Miss Hunt rounds these girls up.

01:21:46.114 --> 01:21:47.323 line:-3
- Ford, I gotta hand it to you.

01:21:47.490 --> 01:21:50.160 line:-3
Using a feminist to dupe a bunch of feminists.

01:21:50.285 --> 01:21:53.580 line:-3
- Well women aren't that smart.

01:21:53.747 --> 01:21:55.081 line:-1
Women.

01:21:55.248 --> 01:21:56.374 line:-3
- Hey, how's your wife?

01:21:58.418 --> 01:21:59.377 line:-3
- It's over.

01:21:59.544 --> 01:22:00.295 line:-2
- Oh.

01:22:04.257 --> 01:22:05.008 line:-2
- Dr. Hunt!

01:22:06.051 --> 01:22:08.511 line:-3
How long have you been standing there?

01:22:08.636 --> 01:22:09.846 line:-3
You didn't hear-

01:22:10.013 --> 01:22:11.139 line:-3
- Anything I didn't already know.

01:22:16.478 --> 01:22:19.230 line:-3
Francine told me all about your dirty little plan.

01:22:19.397 --> 01:22:20.565 line:-2
- Kurtz?

01:22:20.732 --> 01:22:22.150 line:-3
Then you found her?

01:22:22.317 --> 01:22:23.068 line:-3
David Letterman keeps calling,

01:22:23.234 --> 01:22:25.528 line:-3
but we don't know what to tell him.

01:22:25.653 --> 01:22:28.615 line:-3
- I'm afraid Dr. Kurtz won't be doing any more talk shows.

01:22:28.782 --> 01:22:30.075 line:-2
She's dead.

01:22:30.241 --> 01:22:31.034 line:-2
- Dead?

01:22:31.159 --> 01:22:32.077 line:-1
How?

01:22:34.162 --> 01:22:36.956 line:-2
- She died trying to protect the cultural

01:22:37.123 --> 01:22:38.917 line:-3
heritage of a primitive society.

01:22:42.170 --> 01:22:43.380 line:-3
- Not so fast, Professor.

01:22:44.172 --> 01:22:46.049 line:-3
We're not finished with you yet.

01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:49.386 line:-2
Your university-

01:22:49.552 --> 01:22:52.138 line:-3
- Nothing's going to happen to my university.

01:22:52.305 --> 01:22:54.015 line:-2
Except that the Defense Department will provide

01:22:54.182 --> 01:22:57.185 line:-3
a generous grant to feminist studies for research

01:22:57.352 --> 01:23:01.022 line:-2
on expanding women's opportunities in the military.

01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:02.482 line:-1
- You are mad!

01:23:02.649 --> 01:23:05.402 line:-3
- Otherwise, I go on The David Letterman Show myself

01:23:05.568 --> 01:23:07.237 line:-3
and tell him about the Marines, and the millions

01:23:07.404 --> 01:23:09.906 line:-3
of dollars of equipment lost in the Avocado Jungle.

01:23:10.031 --> 01:23:11.908 line:-3
Not to mention the diversion of funds to pay

01:23:12.033 --> 01:23:14.619 line:-3
for Malibu condos and subscriptions to Cosmopolitan.

01:23:15.745 --> 01:23:18.081 line:-2
I can just imagine the sarcastic look

01:23:18.248 --> 01:23:19.582 line:-3
on David's face when he-

01:23:19.749 --> 01:23:20.583 line:-2
- You wouldn't.

01:23:22.794 --> 01:23:23.962 line:-3
- Don't tempt me.

01:23:30.427 --> 01:23:32.095 line:-2
- Women.

01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:34.973 line:-1
(orchestra music)

01:23:44.315 --> 01:23:45.275 line:-1
(knocking)

01:23:45.442 --> 01:23:47.527 line:-3
- Dr. Hunt, I've gotta talk to you.

01:23:47.694 --> 01:23:48.611 line:-3
- Bunny, what's going on?

01:23:48.778 --> 01:23:49.821 line:-3
- I'm getting married to Jim in 10 minutes,

01:23:49.988 --> 01:23:53.158 line:-3
but I don't know, do you think I'm doing the right thing?

01:23:53.324 --> 01:23:54.951 line:-3
- Well - I mean which would be better?

01:23:55.118 --> 01:23:57.120 line:-3
Getting married, being a housewife, and having

01:23:57.287 --> 01:23:59.914 line:-3
a bunch of kids and watching Jim get old and fat, or...

01:24:02.667 --> 01:24:06.087 line:-3
Or finish school and become the first woman president?

01:24:06.254 --> 01:24:09.132 line:-3
- Well Bunny, that's a strictly personal decision.

01:24:09.299 --> 01:24:10.675 line:-3
- Well I'd rather just be a housewife,

01:24:10.842 --> 01:24:13.011 line:-3
but I just don't want to disappoint you

01:24:13.178 --> 01:24:14.512 line:-3
after all you've taught me about...

01:24:14.679 --> 01:24:16.097 line:-3
- Bunny, Bunny, you don't have

01:24:16.264 --> 01:24:17.474 line:-3
to live your life to please me.

01:24:17.599 --> 01:24:19.559 line:-3
The important thing is that you're happy.

01:24:19.726 --> 01:24:22.103 line:-3
And as for what I've taught you, well...

01:24:22.270 --> 01:24:23.646 line:-3
Listen, I've always believed that every

01:24:23.813 --> 01:24:25.607 line:-3
woman should get as much education

01:24:25.774 --> 01:24:28.276 line:-3
and intellectual stimulation as possible.

01:24:28.443 --> 01:24:29.486 line:-3
And that she should develop her

01:24:29.611 --> 01:24:31.654 line:-3
mental abilities to their utmost potential.

01:24:32.822 --> 01:24:36.534 line:-3
But in your case, well, there's just no point.

01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:39.954 line:-3
- Really? Then I should marry him.

01:24:41.706 --> 01:24:44.084 line:-3
- If that's what you want, yes.

01:24:45.710 --> 01:24:47.295 line:-3
- I take it we have your blessing?

01:24:48.421 --> 01:24:49.673 line:-3
- Don't push it.

01:24:49.839 --> 01:24:50.590 line:-3
- Thank you.

01:24:53.385 --> 01:24:55.011 line:-3
- Then I will marry Jim.

01:24:55.178 --> 01:24:57.097 line:-3
But I just feel so sorry for you.

01:24:57.263 --> 01:24:58.598 line:-3
I'm gonna be leaving you here all alone

01:24:58.765 --> 01:25:01.142 line:-3
and you're gonna be losing one of your best students.

01:25:01.309 --> 01:25:02.185 line:-2
- Oh who?

01:25:02.310 --> 01:25:03.269 line:-2
- Me!

01:25:03.436 --> 01:25:04.562 line:-2
- Oh!

01:25:04.729 --> 01:25:05.772 line:-3
Well don't worry, Bunny.

01:25:05.939 --> 01:25:07.649 line:-3
There'll be other students.

01:25:07.816 --> 01:25:09.150 line:-3
- Well this is it, Miss Hunt.

01:25:10.944 --> 01:25:12.028 line:-1
Bye!

01:25:12.153 --> 01:25:13.113 line:-3
I'll call you.

01:25:13.279 --> 01:25:14.197 line:-1
Collect.

01:25:16.449 --> 01:25:17.617 line:-1
Jim.

01:25:17.784 --> 01:25:19.327 line:-2
Goodbye! Thanks for everything!

01:25:20.328 --> 01:25:21.746 line:-1
- Bye.

01:25:21.913 --> 01:25:24.582 line:-1
(playful melody)

01:25:45.562 --> 01:25:46.354 line:-3
- Oh Jean -Pierre!

01:25:46.521 --> 01:25:47.647 line:-3
Good to see you.

01:25:47.814 --> 01:25:49.149 line:-3
Did you get all the classes you wanted?

01:25:49.315 --> 01:25:52.402 line:-3
- Yes, I got all the courses you told me to take.

01:25:52.569 --> 01:25:54.320 line:-2
Introduction to Feminism,

01:25:54.487 --> 01:25:57.198 line:-3
Understanding Human Relationships, and The Sensitive Male.

01:25:57.365 --> 01:25:59.826 line:-3
I want to thank you so much for helping me, Dr. Hunt.

01:25:59.993 --> 01:26:02.078 line:-2
- Oh my pleasure.

01:26:02.203 --> 01:26:03.705 line:-3
Call me Margo.

01:26:03.872 --> 01:26:06.499 align:middle line:0
