00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:02.595 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
>> Judge Patricia: Okay.

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:03.463 align:start line:85% position:10% size:40%
And you say that

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.731 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
they damaged the property.

00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:05.932 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
You say the kids flushed

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:08.001 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
a doll head in the toilet bowl.

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:09.903 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
They took a pickax and shoved

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:10.470 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
that down

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:12.105 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
your outdoor drainage line.

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:12.772 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
>> That is correct.

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:13.673 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
>> Judge Patricia: And actually,

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.941 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
you claim, when they gave notice

00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:15.809 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
that they were gonna break

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:17.210 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
the lease early, you were happy

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:18.211 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
about that because of all --

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:18.611 align:start line:85% position:10% size:28%
>> I was --

00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:19.312 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
>> Judge Patricia: The damage

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:19.813 align:start line:85% position:10% size:30%
they'd done.

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:20.613 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
>> Ecstatic, ecstatic.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.281 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
>> Judge Patricia: And --

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:22.782 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
and then you said that you

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:25.251 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
noticed another family moving in

00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:26.953 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
as they were moving out.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.620 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
So you're seeking

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:29.055 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
to recover several things.

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:29.989 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
One, you want some back rent,

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:30.824 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
$1,000.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:31.157 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
>> Yes.

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:31.758 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
>> Judge Patricia: Two.

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:34.060 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
You want $650 to repair

00:01:34.127 --> 00:01:35.528 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
the property that they damaged.

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:36.896 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
And that would be over and above

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:38.832 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
the $500 that you kept

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:39.732 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
from their security.

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:40.300 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
>> That's correct.

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:41.034 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
>> Judge Patricia: And you also

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.836 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
want late fees for $400.

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:43.636 align:start line:85% position:10% size:40%
Your position is

00:01:43.703 --> 00:01:45.171 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
this wasn't a two-bedroom house.

00:01:45.238 --> 00:01:46.906 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
It was actually a garage

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:48.107 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
that was converted.

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:48.641 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
You called --

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:49.242 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
>> That's not true.

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.776 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
>> Judge Patricia:

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:50.243 align:start line:85% position:10% size:40%
Code enforcement

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.777 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
because you say

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:52.212 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
that the plumbing was bad

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:53.213 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
and there were other problems

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:54.080 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
to the house.

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:54.914 align:start line:85% position:10% size:30%
And in fact,

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:56.249 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
you are even counterclaiming

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:57.684 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
for the return of your security

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.252 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
deposit, $500,

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.387 align:start line:85% position:10% size:20%
and $575

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:03.223 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
in electric bills over and above

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.757 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
what you should've been paying.

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:05.124 align:start line:85% position:10% size:25%
All right.

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:06.159 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
How long was their lease for?

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:06.726 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
>> Their lease was

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:07.193 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
for one year.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.727 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
>> Judge Patricia:

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:08.461 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
Do you have a copy of the lease?

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:08.795 align:start line:85% position:10% size:20%
>> I do.

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:09.496 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
>> Judge Patricia: Can we see

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:14.200 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
that, please?

00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:15.902 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
It says your rent was $800.

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:16.803 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
Is that accurate?

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.337 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
>> It is because --

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:17.871 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
>> Judge Patricia:

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:18.338 align:start line:85% position:10% size:20%
Or $750?

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:18.872 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
>> We included in --

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:19.706 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
we included $50 --

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:20.240 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
>> Judge Patricia:

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:20.740 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
For the electric?

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:21.274 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
>> For the electric

00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:21.975 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
'cause that was the norm,

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:23.109 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
uh, from the tenant before.

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:23.643 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
>> Judge Patricia:

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:24.244 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
Just your electric bill?

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.577 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
>> Yes.

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:25.178 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
>> Judge Patricia: Okay.

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:28.147 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
So now you say that, right away,

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:29.115 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
they started to complain

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:29.949 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
about the plumbing.

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:30.483 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
>> Yes, ma'am.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.451 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
In July, they called me

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:32.652 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
and said there was a problem

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:33.253 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
with the plumbing.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.853 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
>> Judge Patricia: Okay.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.420 align:start line:85% position:10% size:25%
There was.

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:35.054 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
>> There -- there was --

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:35.722 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
>> Judge Patricia: There was

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:36.689 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
a decapitated doll in it.

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:37.323 align:start line:85% position:10% size:25%
>> It was.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.957 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
>> Judge Patricia: So why

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:39.025 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
don't you step up

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:40.827 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
and tell us your name?

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:41.761 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
>> My name is Jordin.

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:42.395 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
>> Judge Patricia: How old

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:43.029 align:start line:85% position:10% size:40%
are you, Jordin?

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:43.563 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
>> Eight.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.397 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
>> Judge Patricia: I'm gonna ask

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:45.031 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
you a bunch of questions.

00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:45.431 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
>> Yes.

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:46.099 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
>> Judge Patricia: You gonna

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:46.599 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
tell me the truth?

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:47.100 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
>> Yes.

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:47.934 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
>> Judge Patricia: Did you put

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.469 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
anything in the toilet bowl?

00:02:49.536 --> 00:02:50.403 align:start line:85% position:10% size:15%
>> No.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.638 align:start line:85% position:10% size:20%
>> Yeah.

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:52.338 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
>> Judge Patricia: Why are you

00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:52.839 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
raising your hand?

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:53.940 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
>> Because it's not him.

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:54.374 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
It's --

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.041 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
>> Judge Patricia: It's

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:55.508 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
the 3-year-old?

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:56.042 align:start line:85% position:10% size:40%
>> It's Stinker.

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:56.743 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
Uh, that's what they --

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:57.176 align:start line:85% position:10% size:25%
>> He's 2.

00:02:57.243 --> 00:02:57.710 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
>> They call him --

00:02:57.777 --> 00:02:58.311 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
>> Judge Patricia: 2.

00:02:58.378 --> 00:02:58.711 align:start line:85% position:10% size:28%
>> Stink --

00:02:58.778 --> 00:02:59.412 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
>> He'll be 3 next month.

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:00.079 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
>> And if you take

00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:00.680 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
a look at this picture,

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:01.981 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
it kinda says a lot. Let me --

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:02.615 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
>> Judge Patricia: Is that

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:03.049 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
his real name?

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:03.349 align:start line:85% position:10% size:15%
>> No.

00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:04.017 align:start line:85% position:10% size:28%
>> Marcell.

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:05.218 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
He's a third.

00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:06.352 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
>> Uh, but I don't know it.

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:06.786 align:start line:85% position:10% size:25%
I'm sorry.

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:07.754 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
I didn't know his name.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.321 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
>> Judge Patricia: Oh,

00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:08.788 align:start line:85% position:10% size:30%
my goodness.

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:09.989 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
Is this your little brother,

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:11.457 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
Stinker, in this picture?

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:11.791 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
>> Yes.

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:12.892 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
>> Judge Patricia: Oh, you're

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:13.793 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
the good boy?

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:14.360 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
>> Yes.

00:03:14.427 --> 00:03:15.061 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
>> Judge Patricia: So you can

00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:15.962 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
go sit down again, okay?

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.063 align:start line:85% position:10% size:25%
Thank you.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.364 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
But you never saw him do that.

00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:19.132 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
You never saw anybody

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:19.766 align:start line:85% position:10% size:30%
do anything.

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:21.267 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
>> Uh, no, ma'am. But he did.

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:22.201 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
That's why I wanted to --

00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:22.902 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
>> Judge Patricia: So you want

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:23.770 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
him to give up his brother.

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:24.203 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
>> No, no, no.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.904 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
I'm not asking him

00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:25.705 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
to give him to me.

00:03:25.772 --> 00:03:27.574 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
I want him to give up the truth

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.841 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
because when we --

00:03:28.908 --> 00:03:30.310 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
he was there when I pulled that

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:31.911 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
anvil out of the cleanout.

00:03:31.978 --> 00:03:32.445 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
>> Judge Patricia:

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:33.112 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
Oh, I meant to tell you --

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:33.646 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
>> Well, not anvil.

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:34.347 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
>> Judge Patricia: This thing.

00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:34.747 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
He's 2!

00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:35.515 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
He couldn't lift this thing up

00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:36.449 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
and put it in there!

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:37.216 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
>> Ma'am, ask him.

00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:38.985 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
He's the one that told us.

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:39.686 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
>> Judge Patricia: Jordin,

00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:40.320 align:start line:85% position:10% size:30%
who put that

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:41.387 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
in the drain in the yard?

00:03:41.454 --> 00:03:41.888 align:start line:85% position:10% size:30%
Do you know?

00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:42.455 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
>> My brother.

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:44.090 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
>> Judge Patricia: Your brother?

00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:46.192 align:start line:85% position:10% size:30%
[ Laughter ]

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:48.561 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
>> I rest my case.

00:03:48.628 --> 00:03:49.162 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
>> Judge Patricia: Now,

00:03:49.228 --> 00:03:49.629 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
they move out.

00:03:49.696 --> 00:03:50.763 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
You're happy they're moving out.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:51.364 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
>> Yes, ma'am.

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:52.065 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
>> Judge Patricia: What month

00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:52.732 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
are you saying

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.233 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
that they owe you rent for?

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.069 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
>> $250 for August,

00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:57.403 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
and all of September.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.705 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
>> Judge Patricia: So $250 for

00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:00.940 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
August and $750 for September.

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:01.441 align:start line:85% position:10% size:28%
>> Correct.

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:02.175 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
>> Judge Patricia: When did you

00:04:02.241 --> 00:04:03.309 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
move out officially,

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:03.743 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
September 1st?

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:04.510 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
>> It was September the 3rd.

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:04.844 align:start line:85% position:10% size:20%
>> Yeah.

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:05.545 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
>> Judge Patricia: Did you --

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:05.912 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
>> Third.

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:06.646 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
>> Judge Patricia: Pay any rent

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:08.081 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
to him for the month of August?

00:04:08.147 --> 00:04:09.415 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
>> I -- I gave him August, yes,

00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:10.049 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
was completed.

00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:10.883 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
Um, September,

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.418 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
I gave him a $500 money order.

00:04:12.485 --> 00:04:12.719 align:start line:85% position:10% size:15%
>> Mm.

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:13.419 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
>> Judge Patricia: Do you have

00:04:13.486 --> 00:04:14.120 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
a copy of the money order?

00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:15.488 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
You should have some kind of --

00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:15.822 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
>> Yes.

00:04:15.888 --> 00:04:16.456 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
>> Judge Patricia: Proof

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:16.789 align:start line:85% position:10% size:20%
of that.

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:17.690 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
Did you find new tenants

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:18.458 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
for the apartment?

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:19.192 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
>> Yes.

00:04:19.258 --> 00:04:19.926 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
>> Judge Patricia: And who were

00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:20.360 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
these people?

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:20.827 align:start line:85% position:10% size:40%
>> Um, employee,

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:22.428 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
uh, fellow employees.

00:04:22.495 --> 00:04:23.096 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
>> Judge Patricia: Of yours?

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:23.563 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
>> Yes.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.764 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
They got a month-to-month

00:04:24.831 --> 00:04:25.498 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
agreement that was --

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:26.199 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
>> Judge Patricia: Do you have

00:04:26.265 --> 00:04:26.833 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
a lease for these people?

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:27.600 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
>> I have a month-to-month

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:28.501 align:start line:85% position:10% size:40%
after they left.

00:04:28.568 --> 00:04:29.035 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
>> Judge Patricia:

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:29.569 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
Let's see that.

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:30.269 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
So what's your complaint?

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:31.304 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
>> My complaint is,

00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:33.239 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
she moved 'em in 30 days before.

00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:34.007 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
>> They were just helping us

00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:34.374 align:start line:85% position:10% size:20%
clean --

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.841 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
>> They, um --

00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:35.375 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
>> Clean the place.

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:36.109 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
>> They was supposed to be there

00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:36.676 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
to help clean so that

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:37.644 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
we could get our deposit back.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:38.645 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
>> Judge Patricia: But if he

00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:39.512 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
agreed,

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:40.380 align:start line:85% position:10% size:40%
why would he not

00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:41.648 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
want these people in the home?

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:42.849 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
Because then, he would be

00:04:42.915 --> 00:04:43.916 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
getting money from them?

00:04:43.983 --> 00:04:44.283 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
>> Right.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.084 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
>> Judge Patricia: If he didn't

00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:45.385 align:start line:85% position:10% size:15%
agree,

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:45.952 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
I could see him

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:47.253 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
having a problem with that.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.454 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
So that's what sort of makes

00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:49.622 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
your story a little difficult

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:50.890 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
because he's asking for 1,000

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:51.658 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
in back rent.

00:04:51.724 --> 00:04:53.092 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
You say that this money order

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:54.827 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
reflects that you gave him 500,

00:04:54.894 --> 00:04:55.361 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
and they were

00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:56.796 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
supposed to give him 250.

00:04:56.863 --> 00:04:57.530 align:start line:85% position:10% size:28%
>> Correct.

00:04:57.597 --> 00:04:58.331 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
>> Judge Patricia: I don't know

00:04:58.398 --> 00:04:58.898 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
whether that happens.

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:01.034 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
He claims you took that 250.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.368 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
But you would owe a full month's

00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:04.037 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
rent for September.

00:05:04.103 --> 00:05:05.304 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
Now, moving along,

00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:06.839 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
the damages that were caused,

00:05:06.906 --> 00:05:08.107 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
we need to see some proof

00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:08.641 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
of the damages --

00:05:08.708 --> 00:05:09.275 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
>> I have it right here.

00:05:09.342 --> 00:05:09.909 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
>> Judge Patricia: As well

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:11.144 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
as the fact that they did it.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.844 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
What is that you wanna --

00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:12.311 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
>> These are --

00:05:12.378 --> 00:05:13.112 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
these are receipts, Your Honor.

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:13.713 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
>> Judge Patricia: For?

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.181 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
>> Plumbing, uh, repairs and --

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:15.882 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
>> Judge Patricia: All right.

00:05:15.948 --> 00:05:16.449 align:start line:85% position:10% size:40%
We'll take that.

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:17.183 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
I'd like to see a picture of

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.418 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
the place that you rented also

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:19.252 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
because you're claiming

00:05:19.318 --> 00:05:20.420 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
as though it was a disaster.

00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:21.020 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
So I'd like to --

00:05:21.087 --> 00:05:21.387 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
>> It is.

00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:21.988 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
>> Judge Patricia: See.

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:22.588 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
>> It had no insulation.

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:23.156 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
Uh, here's a --

00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:23.890 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
>> Judge Patricia: But you moved

00:05:23.956 --> 00:05:24.157 align:start line:85% position:10% size:08%
in.

00:05:24.223 --> 00:05:24.724 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
>> Picture of before.

00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:25.458 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
>> Yeah. Yeah. We -- we was --

00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:26.192 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
>> Judge Patricia: You moved in.

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:26.726 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
And you lived there.

00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:27.527 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
>> Moving in from out of state.

00:05:27.593 --> 00:05:27.927 align:start line:85% position:10% size:30%
So we moved.

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:28.561 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
>> Judge Patricia: Enough,

00:05:28.628 --> 00:05:29.028 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
enough, enough.

00:05:29.095 --> 00:05:29.696 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
But the place is left fine.

00:05:29.762 --> 00:05:30.630 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
I mean, it doesn't look damaged.

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:31.230 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
>> Oh, that's not --

00:05:31.297 --> 00:05:31.964 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
that's not how it was left.

00:05:32.031 --> 00:05:33.032 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
That's the before.

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:34.300 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
>> Judge Patricia: So this is

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:34.734 align:start line:85% position:10% size:25%
how you're

00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:36.102 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
saying they left the premises?

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.270 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
>> Uh, yes, ma'am.

00:05:37.336 --> 00:05:38.271 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
That's how it was

00:05:38.337 --> 00:05:39.272 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
when I got there.

00:05:39.338 --> 00:05:40.139 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
>> That was in the process

00:05:40.206 --> 00:05:41.274 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
of us moving out.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:41.874 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
>> Of moving out, yeah.

00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:42.542 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
>> Judge Patricia: You know,

00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:43.342 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
the process of moving, it seems,

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:44.911 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
by tenants in this courtroom,

00:05:44.977 --> 00:05:45.478 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
is to just take

00:05:45.545 --> 00:05:46.145 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
everything they own

00:05:46.212 --> 00:05:47.413 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
and throw it all in a pile.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.981 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
And they say, "We were moving."

00:05:49.048 --> 00:05:50.450 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
So how do you show

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:51.484 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
that he's overcharged you

00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:52.752 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
in your electric bills?

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:53.920 align:start line:85% position:10% size:40%
>> Um, actually,

00:05:53.986 --> 00:05:55.621 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
our electric bills from my house

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:56.322 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
that I live in now,

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:57.190 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
which is over 11 --

00:05:57.256 --> 00:05:58.391 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
1,100 square feet,

00:05:58.458 --> 00:05:59.058 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
compared to --

00:05:59.125 --> 00:05:59.592 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
>> Judge Patricia:

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:00.059 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
Oh, oh, no, no.

00:06:00.126 --> 00:06:00.526 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
>> Theirs is --

00:06:00.593 --> 00:06:01.127 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
>> Judge Patricia: See,

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:01.828 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
that's the problem here.

00:06:01.894 --> 00:06:02.295 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
You were there.

00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:02.795 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
You were using it.

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:03.529 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
And it was no insulation.

00:06:03.596 --> 00:06:04.897 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
And you basically stayed there.

00:06:04.964 --> 00:06:06.199 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
So bottom line is,

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:07.467 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
I'm not really sure about

00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:08.434 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
your counterclaim

00:06:08.501 --> 00:06:09.869 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
although I'm gonna listen to it.

00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:11.304 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
And I'm going to pass the case

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.039 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
over to Judge Corriero.

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:13.606 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
>> Judge Michael: Now,

00:06:13.673 --> 00:06:14.574 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
the defendant says

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.576 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
that it was a converted garage.

00:06:16.642 --> 00:06:17.176 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
>> Well, you can look at

00:06:17.243 --> 00:06:17.710 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
the pictures and --

00:06:17.777 --> 00:06:18.311 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
>> Judge Michael: And --

00:06:18.377 --> 00:06:18.911 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
and you didn't --

00:06:18.978 --> 00:06:19.445 align:start line:85% position:10% size:40%
>> See it's not.

00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:19.946 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
>> Judge Michael:

00:06:20.012 --> 00:06:20.680 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
Have the proper permits for it.

00:06:20.747 --> 00:06:21.347 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
And that's probably why

00:06:21.414 --> 00:06:22.582 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
the plumbing didn't work right.

00:06:22.648 --> 00:06:23.716 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
>> Well, let me show you

00:06:23.783 --> 00:06:25.518 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
what the city of Fresno said.

00:06:25.585 --> 00:06:27.520 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
It's a legal, rentable spot.

00:06:27.587 --> 00:06:28.121 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
It's not a --

00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:28.755 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
it's not a garage --

00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:29.422 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
>> Judge Michael: You've

00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:29.922 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
got to prove that.

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:30.423 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
>> As they assume.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.791 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
Um, I have nothing to prove.

00:06:31.858 --> 00:06:32.291 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
That is -- I --

00:06:32.358 --> 00:06:33.292 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
I didn't know I needed anything

00:06:33.359 --> 00:06:33.793 align:start line:85% position:10% size:40%
to prove that --

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:34.460 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
>> Judge Michael: Were there

00:06:34.527 --> 00:06:34.961 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
dogs living there?

00:06:35.027 --> 00:06:35.561 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
>> It was a legal spot.

00:06:35.628 --> 00:06:36.262 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
>> Judge Michael: Was it used

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:36.596 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
somehow

00:06:36.662 --> 00:06:37.230 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
as a doghouse in the past?

00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:37.830 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
>> No. No. When they --

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:38.631 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
what they're speaking of is

00:06:38.698 --> 00:06:39.999 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
I had a couple of Rottweilers

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:40.933 align:start line:85% position:10% size:40%
run in that yard

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.034 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
to protect the yard.

00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:43.102 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
>> The dogs were in the house.

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:43.870 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
There was dog hair

00:06:43.936 --> 00:06:44.804 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%

that the plumbing was damaged

00:08:45.992 --> 00:08:47.059 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
>> Judge Tanya: Judge DiMango

00:08:47.126 --> 00:08:47.493 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
just handed me

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.195 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
a invoice and a statement

00:08:49.262 --> 00:08:51.030 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
from plumbing where it says,

00:08:51.097 --> 00:08:52.465 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
"Pulled out no roots.

00:08:52.531 --> 00:08:54.133 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
Had to be obstacles thrown down

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:54.767 align:start line:85% position:10% size:25%
the toilet

00:08:54.834 --> 00:08:56.335 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
other than toilet paper."

00:08:56.402 --> 00:08:57.103 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
So the plumber

00:08:57.169 --> 00:08:58.371 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
didn't find any roots.

00:08:58.437 --> 00:08:59.205 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
I'm -- I'm done now.

00:08:59.272 --> 00:09:00.740 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
Case aside, you guys have raised

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:02.008 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
a great young man.

00:09:02.074 --> 00:09:03.142 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
By the way, what do you wanna be

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:04.110 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
when you grow up?

00:09:04.176 --> 00:09:04.944 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
>> A cop.

00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:05.978 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
>> Judge Tanya: Bravo.

00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:06.279 align:start line:85% position:10% size:15%
>> Mm.

00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:07.213 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
>> Judge Tanya: This -- Bravo.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.015 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
Right there. Right there.

00:09:09.081 --> 00:09:09.715 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
>> Judge Patricia: All right.

00:09:09.782 --> 00:09:10.316 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
We're gonna retire

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:11.317 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
to deliberate. Thank you, all.

continues in a moment.

00:09:13.686 --> 00:09:15.321 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
And later today...

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:15.955 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
>> Judge Tanya: You admit

00:09:16.022 --> 00:09:16.889 align:start line:85% position:10% size:40%
that your sister

00:09:16.956 --> 00:09:18.791 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
loaned this money to you.

00:09:18.858 --> 00:09:19.492 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
It was bail money.

00:09:19.558 --> 00:09:20.226 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
Let's just cut to the chase.

00:09:20.293 --> 00:09:20.559 align:start line:85% position:10% size:20%
>> Yeah.

00:09:20.626 --> 00:09:21.127 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
>> Judge Tanya: Right?

00:09:21.193 --> 00:09:21.460 align:start line:85% position:10% size:20%
>> Yeah.

00:09:21.527 --> 00:09:22.094 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
>> Judge Tanya: Who was it

00:09:22.161 --> 00:09:29.669 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
that she bailed out?

00:09:29.735 --> 00:09:30.836 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
>> Announcer: Three judges.

00:09:30.903 --> 00:09:32.038 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
Three opinions.

00:09:32.104 --> 00:09:33.572 align:start line:85% position:10% size:30%
One verdict.

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:36.142 align:start line:85% position:10% size:30%
"Hot Bench."

00:09:36.208 --> 00:09:38.110 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
Rondy Packard says

00:09:38.177 --> 00:09:40.246 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
former tenants Christa Smith

00:09:40.313 --> 00:09:42.682 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
and Marcell Davis moved out,

00:09:42.748 --> 00:09:43.816 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
owing for rent

00:09:43.883 --> 00:09:45.685 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
and property damage.

00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:47.453 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
The defendants are countersuing

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.087 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
for the return

00:09:48.154 --> 00:09:49.655 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
of their security deposit

00:09:49.722 --> 00:09:51.357 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
and utility bills.

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:52.091 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
>> Judge Patricia: Do you think

00:09:52.158 --> 00:09:52.959 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
we should adjourn this

00:09:53.025 --> 00:09:54.493 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
for Stinker to come in

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.461 align:start line:85% position:10% size:30%
and testify?

00:09:55.528 --> 00:09:56.162 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
>> Judge Michael: Do you have

00:09:56.228 --> 00:09:56.796 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
the photograph of Stinker?

00:09:56.862 --> 00:09:57.396 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
>> Judge Patricia: I do

00:09:57.463 --> 00:09:57.863 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
with the stick.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:58.264 align:start line:85% position:10% size:30%
There he is.

00:09:58.331 --> 00:09:58.831 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
>> Judge Michael: Yes.

00:09:58.898 --> 00:09:59.632 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
>> Judge Patricia: Sneaking out

00:09:59.699 --> 00:10:00.299 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
behind the -- the woodwork.

00:10:00.366 --> 00:10:00.866 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
>> Judge Michael: Yes.

00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:02.034 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
He looks like he's somewhat

00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:03.169 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
of a -- a mischievous --

00:10:03.235 --> 00:10:03.669 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
>> Judge Patricia:

00:10:03.736 --> 00:10:04.904 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
Mischievous is the word.

00:10:04.971 --> 00:10:05.571 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
>> Judge Patricia: Good word

00:10:05.638 --> 00:10:05.905 align:start line:85% position:10% size:20%
for him.

00:10:05.972 --> 00:10:06.605 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
>> Judge Michael: Young child.

00:10:06.672 --> 00:10:07.206 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
But I cannot connect him

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:07.640 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
to any crimes

00:10:07.707 --> 00:10:09.108 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
that I'm totally aware of.

00:10:09.175 --> 00:10:10.343 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
First of all, I think

00:10:10.409 --> 00:10:12.478 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
that the allegations about

00:10:12.545 --> 00:10:14.313 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
the landlord I find credible.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.114 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
>> Judge Patricia: I don't know

00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:17.016 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
if I feel exactly the same way.

00:10:17.083 --> 00:10:18.250 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
I haven't seen proof

00:10:18.317 --> 00:10:19.485 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
of the unpaid rent. I don't know

00:10:19.552 --> 00:10:20.419 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
if anybody else did.

00:10:20.486 --> 00:10:21.520 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
>> Judge Tanya: We have 250

00:10:21.587 --> 00:10:22.455 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
that was conceded.

00:10:22.521 --> 00:10:23.789 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
>> Judge Patricia: He says 250's

00:10:23.856 --> 00:10:24.757 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
for August and that --

00:10:24.824 --> 00:10:25.358 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
>> Judge Michael: Right.

00:10:25.424 --> 00:10:26.058 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
>> Judge Patricia: The 750 is

00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:26.525 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
for September.

00:10:26.592 --> 00:10:27.226 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
They're saying --

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:27.793 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
>> Judge Michael: They

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:28.928 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
gave him $500

00:10:28.995 --> 00:10:29.996 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
on August 30th.

00:10:30.062 --> 00:10:30.663 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
>> Judge Patricia: Right.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.231 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
So that's either for

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:33.132 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
August or September.

00:10:33.199 --> 00:10:34.400 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
So it could be either way.

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:35.001 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
>> Judge Michael: Right.

00:10:35.067 --> 00:10:35.701 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
>> Judge Patricia: So, I mean,

00:10:35.768 --> 00:10:36.569 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
since we don't have proof

00:10:36.635 --> 00:10:37.770 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
that September's been paid,

00:10:37.837 --> 00:10:38.738 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
and we have the 250 --

00:10:38.804 --> 00:10:39.739 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
We do have the 1,000.

00:10:39.805 --> 00:10:40.673 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
I don't wanna give him

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.407 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
the late fees

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:42.274 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
because we don't really know

00:10:42.341 --> 00:10:43.476 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
how late anything was.

00:10:43.542 --> 00:10:44.643 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
So we don't have a way

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:45.544 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
of calculating it

00:10:45.611 --> 00:10:46.412 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
based on the lease.

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:47.213 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
>> Judge Michael: You don't have

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:47.613 align:start line:85% position:10% size:28%
any problem

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.614 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
with believing that this --

00:10:48.681 --> 00:10:49.215 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
>> Judge Patricia: Yeah,

00:10:49.281 --> 00:10:49.615 align:start line:85% position:10% size:25%
I don't --

00:10:49.682 --> 00:10:50.383 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
>> Judge Michael: Converted shed

00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:51.150 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
is habitable by people?

00:10:51.217 --> 00:10:51.817 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
>> Judge Tanya: No.

00:10:51.884 --> 00:10:52.785 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
>> Judge Patricia: Oh, I think

00:10:52.852 --> 00:10:53.352 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
it's habitable.

00:10:53.419 --> 00:10:54.086 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
But I think when -- I think --

00:10:54.153 --> 00:10:54.854 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
>> Judge Michael: Where's

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:55.654 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
a certificate of occupancy

00:10:55.721 --> 00:10:56.522 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
or proof that this is a place

00:10:56.589 --> 00:10:57.123 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
that you can rent

00:10:57.189 --> 00:10:57.590 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
out to people?

00:10:57.656 --> 00:10:58.424 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
>> Judge Patricia: A lot of

00:10:58.491 --> 00:10:58.991 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
people rent these

00:10:59.058 --> 00:10:59.992 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
types of premises.

00:11:00.059 --> 00:11:00.659 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
And they do it.

00:11:00.726 --> 00:11:01.427 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
You can't just say

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:01.994 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
you can live there,

00:11:02.061 --> 00:11:03.095 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
but then turn around and say,

00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:03.729 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
"Well, it's not really --"

00:11:03.796 --> 00:11:04.363 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
>> Judge Michael: Well, if

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:05.164 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
you need to live there.

00:11:05.231 --> 00:11:05.898 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
>> Judge Tanya: But even though

00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:08.134 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
this report from the city

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.435 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
does pertain to the plumbing,

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:11.804 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
this is a city agency.

00:11:11.871 --> 00:11:12.772 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
And if a city agency

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:14.407 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
comes out to a premises

00:11:14.473 --> 00:11:15.441 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
that's not permitted,

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:16.409 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
even if they're gonna check

00:11:16.475 --> 00:11:17.043 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
an unrelated issue --

00:11:17.109 --> 00:11:17.743 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
>> Judge Patricia: Absolutely.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:18.344 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
>> Judge Tanya: I think

00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:19.145 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
he would've been cited for that.

00:11:19.211 --> 00:11:19.812 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
>> Judge Patricia: They do.

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:20.746 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
And we've seen that before.

00:11:20.813 --> 00:11:21.614 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
>> Judge Tanya: I think he

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.381 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
would've been cited.

00:11:22.448 --> 00:11:23.449 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
>> Judge Patricia: So assuming,

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:24.250 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
for argument's sake,

00:11:24.316 --> 00:11:25.184 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
that we get through

00:11:25.251 --> 00:11:26.485 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
the $1,000 rent

00:11:26.552 --> 00:11:27.586 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
and some of the property

00:11:27.653 --> 00:11:28.320 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
damages, should --

00:11:28.387 --> 00:11:29.088 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
>> Judge Tanya: I think

00:11:29.155 --> 00:11:30.222 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
that they're on the hook

00:11:30.289 --> 00:11:30.923 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
for the property damages.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:31.624 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
>> Judge Patricia: I do, too.

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:32.091 align:start line:85% position:10% size:40%
I can't help it.

00:11:32.158 --> 00:11:32.758 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
>> Judge Tanya: Because I

00:11:32.825 --> 00:11:33.526 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
actually found the plaintiff

00:11:33.592 --> 00:11:33.926 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
credible.

00:11:33.993 --> 00:11:35.161 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
And he had evidence for all.

00:11:35.227 --> 00:11:35.628 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
I do feel

00:11:35.694 --> 00:11:36.662 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
like he carried his burden.

00:11:36.729 --> 00:11:37.463 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
>> Judge Michael: So

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:38.164 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
he's suing for --

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:38.798 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
>> Judge Patricia: $900.

00:11:38.864 --> 00:11:39.398 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
>> Judge Michael: $900.

00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:40.900 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
And you both are prepared

00:11:40.966 --> 00:11:41.801 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
to give him how much?

00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:42.535 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
>> Judge Patricia: $900

00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:42.935 align:start line:85% position:10% size:28%
based on --

00:11:43.002 --> 00:11:44.036 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
>> Judge Tanya: $900.

00:11:44.103 --> 00:11:44.770 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
>> Judge Patricia: The bills and

00:11:44.837 --> 00:11:45.304 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
then the $1,000 rent

00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:46.439 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
but not the late fees.

00:11:46.505 --> 00:11:47.073 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
And with regard

00:11:47.139 --> 00:11:48.174 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
to their counterclaim,

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.776 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
he's gonna keep the $500 deposit

00:11:50.843 --> 00:11:51.477 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
because he's already

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:52.044 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
utilized that.

00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:52.878 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
And the utility bills,

00:11:52.945 --> 00:11:53.846 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
they didn't show any proof.

00:11:53.913 --> 00:11:54.980 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
>> Judge Tanya: She doesn't have

00:11:55.047 --> 00:11:55.648 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
any evidence.

00:11:55.714 --> 00:11:56.348 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
All she says is that

00:11:56.415 --> 00:11:57.216 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
"Our bills are less now."

00:11:57.283 --> 00:11:57.883 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
>> Judge Michael: I guess my

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:01.087 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
feeling is that this place

00:12:01.153 --> 00:12:02.388 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
that they've rented out

00:12:02.455 --> 00:12:03.789 align:start line:85% position:10% size:30%
of necessity

00:12:03.856 --> 00:12:04.990 align:start line:85% position:10% size:28%
wasn't kept

00:12:05.057 --> 00:12:06.625 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
in the best of shape by him.

00:12:06.692 --> 00:12:07.893 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
But I can't prove that.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:08.928 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
That's just a feeling.

00:12:08.994 --> 00:12:10.529 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
So I will go along with

00:12:10.596 --> 00:12:11.263 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
both of your views.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:12.398 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
>> Judge Patricia: So $1,900?

00:12:12.465 --> 00:12:13.099 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
>> Judge Tanya: Yeah, so that

00:12:13.165 --> 00:12:13.899 align:start line:85% position:10% size:20%
includes

00:12:13.966 --> 00:12:16.569 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
the 900 he's claiming is absent

00:12:16.635 --> 00:12:17.369 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
their security deposit.

00:12:17.436 --> 00:12:18.037 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
>> Judge Patricia: Correct.

00:12:18.104 --> 00:12:18.604 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
>> Judge Tanya: Okay.

00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:19.271 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
>> Judge Patricia: Perfect?

00:12:19.338 --> 00:12:21.474 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
>> Judge Tanya: Very good.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:22.208 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
>> Sonia: Remain seated.

00:12:22.274 --> 00:12:22.808 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
Come to order.

00:12:22.875 --> 00:12:23.709 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
This courtroom is again

00:12:23.776 --> 00:12:25.244 align:start line:85% position:10% size:28%
in session.

00:12:25.311 --> 00:12:26.278 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
>> Judge Patricia: Well, I know

00:12:26.345 --> 00:12:27.680 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
you wanted to point the finger

00:12:27.746 --> 00:12:29.715 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
at the absentee Stinker.

00:12:29.782 --> 00:12:30.583 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
But nevertheless,

00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:31.584 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
even if he did it,

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.385 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
it would be your responsibility

00:12:33.452 --> 00:12:34.753 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
because he's your child.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.122 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
The bottom line here is,

00:12:36.188 --> 00:12:37.056 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
you didn't meet your burden

00:12:37.123 --> 00:12:37.790 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
on every issue.

00:12:37.857 --> 00:12:38.991 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
But you did meet it on some.

00:12:39.058 --> 00:12:40.292 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
We do believe that they owe you

00:12:40.359 --> 00:12:41.660 align:start line:85% position:10% size:30%
$1,000 rent.

00:12:41.727 --> 00:12:42.928 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
We do believe that you

00:12:42.995 --> 00:12:44.897 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
are entitled to the $900

00:12:44.964 --> 00:12:46.165 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
in the property damage.

00:12:46.232 --> 00:12:47.099 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
So to that extent,

00:12:47.166 --> 00:12:48.434 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
you'll get $1,900.

00:12:48.501 --> 00:12:48.968 align:start line:85% position:10% size:40%
You're not gonna

00:12:49.034 --> 00:12:49.635 align:start line:85% position:10% size:40%
get the balance.

00:12:49.702 --> 00:12:50.236 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
And with regard

00:12:50.302 --> 00:12:51.303 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
to your counterclaim,

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.037 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
you really failed

00:12:52.104 --> 00:12:53.072 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
to meet your burden there,

00:12:53.139 --> 00:12:53.839 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
which would be to have

00:12:53.906 --> 00:12:54.440 align:start line:85% position:10% size:28%
established

00:12:54.507 --> 00:12:55.674 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
that you did overpay

00:12:55.741 --> 00:12:57.009 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
7 months' worth of rent

00:12:57.076 --> 00:12:59.278 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
by $75 a month

00:12:59.345 --> 00:13:00.846 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
and that you are entitled

00:13:00.913 --> 00:13:01.413 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
to the return

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.681 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
of your security deposit

00:13:02.748 --> 00:13:04.216 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
based on what we see here.

00:13:04.283 --> 00:13:05.918 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
But what we all agree

00:13:05.985 --> 00:13:07.052 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
on one thing,

00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:09.021 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
that you are just

00:13:09.088 --> 00:13:10.456 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
a terrific young man.

00:13:10.523 --> 00:13:11.323 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
And that's the judgment

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:12.424 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
of the court.

00:13:12.491 --> 00:13:13.292 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
>> Sonia: This courtroom

00:13:13.359 --> 00:13:15.194 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
is now in recess.

00:13:15.261 --> 00:13:15.961 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
>> Money-hungry people

00:13:16.028 --> 00:13:16.862 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
get what they want, I guess.

00:13:16.929 --> 00:13:18.330 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
>> Just gold-diggers

00:13:18.397 --> 00:13:19.064 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
trying to get some money.

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:21.133 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
>> He's very childish.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:21.700 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
>> Announcer: And now

00:13:21.767 --> 00:13:22.535 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
the next case.

00:13:22.601 --> 00:13:23.802 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
>> Sonia: Case number 312

00:13:23.869 --> 00:13:25.571 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
on calendar, Martinez vs.

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:27.773 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
Dibble, please step forward.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.208 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
>> Announcer: Kathy Martinez

00:13:29.275 --> 00:13:31.010 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
is suing her sister,

00:13:31.076 --> 00:13:32.244 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
Loretta Dibble,

00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:34.046 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
for an unpaid loan.

00:13:34.113 --> 00:13:35.748 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
>> Judge Tanya: Ms. Martinez,

00:13:35.814 --> 00:13:36.749 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
the defendant

00:13:36.815 --> 00:13:37.683 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
is your little sister.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:38.984 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
She asked you to loan her

00:13:39.051 --> 00:13:39.852 align:start line:85% position:10% size:28%
some money.

00:13:39.919 --> 00:13:40.753 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
She told you that

00:13:40.819 --> 00:13:43.088 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
she'd pay you back in 60 days.

00:13:43.155 --> 00:13:43.923 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
You took the money

00:13:43.989 --> 00:13:45.724 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
out of your retirement account.

00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:46.058 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
>> Yes.

00:13:46.125 --> 00:13:46.825 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
>> Judge Tanya: And now you're

00:13:46.892 --> 00:13:47.259 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
claiming that

00:13:47.326 --> 00:13:48.661 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
she's refusing to pay you back.

00:13:48.727 --> 00:13:49.461 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
And you're suing her

00:13:49.528 --> 00:13:51.096 align:start line:85% position:10% size:40%
for that $2,700.

>> That's correct, Your Honor.

00:13:51.931 --> 00:13:52.731 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
>> Judge Tanya: And, Ms. Dibble,

00:13:52.798 --> 00:13:54.433 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
you admit that your sister

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.402 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
loaned this money to you.

00:13:56.468 --> 00:13:57.102 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
It was bail money.

00:13:57.169 --> 00:13:57.603 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
Let's just cut

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:58.470 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
to the chase, right?

00:13:58.537 --> 00:13:58.837 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
>> Right.

00:13:58.904 --> 00:13:59.438 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
>> Judge Tanya: You got

00:13:59.505 --> 00:13:59.972 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
the money for bail.

00:14:00.039 --> 00:14:00.339 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
>> Right.

00:14:00.406 --> 00:14:01.106 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
>> Judge Tanya: And then it's

00:14:01.173 --> 00:14:01.540 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
your position

00:14:01.607 --> 00:14:03.142 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
that she as only gonna be repaid

00:14:03.209 --> 00:14:04.076 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
if the person she was

00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:06.445 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
bailing out sold some property.

00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:07.880 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
And then when that person

00:14:07.947 --> 00:14:08.981 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
got bailed out,

00:14:09.048 --> 00:14:10.916 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
they skipped town.

00:14:10.983 --> 00:14:11.617 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
And you claim

00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:12.651 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
you're not on the hook for that.

00:14:12.718 --> 00:14:13.018 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
>> Right.

00:14:13.085 --> 00:14:13.919 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
>> Judge Tanya: Who was it

00:14:13.986 --> 00:14:14.920 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
that she bailed out?

You're not telling the truth.

00:14:18.757 --> 00:14:19.158 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
>> She told me

00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:20.526 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
she didn't want me to do that.

00:14:20.593 --> 00:14:21.126 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
She just wanted cash.

coming out of those two lips

00:14:46.986 --> 00:14:47.920 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
that she bailed out?

00:14:47.987 --> 00:14:49.088 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
>> Uh, my roommate.

00:14:49.154 --> 00:14:49.655 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
>> That's not why

00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:50.356 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
I gave it to her.

00:14:50.422 --> 00:14:51.523 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
I had no idea at the time

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:52.291 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
that I gave it to her that --

00:14:52.358 --> 00:14:53.292 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
>> Judge Tanya: Aha.

00:14:53.359 --> 00:14:54.026 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
>> For bail money.

00:14:54.093 --> 00:14:54.727 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
>> Judge Tanya: So how is it

00:14:54.793 --> 00:14:55.394 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
that you came

00:14:55.461 --> 00:14:56.528 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
to give your sister this money?

00:14:56.595 --> 00:14:57.329 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
What did she tell you?

00:14:57.396 --> 00:14:58.464 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
>> That she needed it

00:14:58.530 --> 00:14:59.465 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
for a personal loan.

00:14:59.531 --> 00:15:00.199 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
>> Judge Tanya: Do you have any

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:00.899 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
evidence that you

00:15:00.966 --> 00:15:01.667 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
pulled these proceeds

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:02.768 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
out of your retirement account?

00:15:02.835 --> 00:15:03.168 align:start line:85% position:10% size:20%
>> I do.

00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:03.902 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
>> Judge Tanya: May I see that?

00:15:03.969 --> 00:15:04.536 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
Ms. Dibble, you claim

00:15:04.603 --> 00:15:05.738 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
that your sister became aware

00:15:05.804 --> 00:15:06.872 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
of your need for this money

00:15:06.939 --> 00:15:08.107 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
after you had a three-way

00:15:08.173 --> 00:15:08.707 align:start line:85% position:10% size:25%
phone call

00:15:08.774 --> 00:15:09.908 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
with her and the person --

00:15:09.975 --> 00:15:10.276 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
>> Right.

00:15:10.342 --> 00:15:10.943 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
>> Judge Tanya: In jail and

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:12.177 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
that she knew that the only way

00:15:12.244 --> 00:15:13.612 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
she was gonna get repaid was

00:15:13.679 --> 00:15:14.947 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
if this person in jail

00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:16.015 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
sold some property.

00:15:16.081 --> 00:15:17.082 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
Do you have any proof?

00:15:17.149 --> 00:15:17.783 align:start line:85% position:10% size:15%
>> No.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:18.651 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
What happened was,

00:15:18.717 --> 00:15:20.452 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
I was at her house.

00:15:20.519 --> 00:15:21.720 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
Um, I got the phone call.

00:15:21.787 --> 00:15:22.321 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
>> Judge Tanya: What was

00:15:22.388 --> 00:15:23.188 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
your roommate in jail for?

00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:24.623 align:start line:85% position:10% size:30%
>> Speeding.

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.191 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
He was on a motorcycle and tried

00:15:26.258 --> 00:15:28.294 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
to outrun the police

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.495 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
and got caught.

00:15:29.561 --> 00:15:30.262 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
>> Judge Tanya: Who'd she give

00:15:30.329 --> 00:15:30.696 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
the money to?

00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:31.297 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
Did you take the money?

00:15:31.363 --> 00:15:32.064 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
>> She gave it to me.

00:15:32.131 --> 00:15:32.665 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
>> Judge Tanya: To bail

00:15:32.731 --> 00:15:33.165 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
out your roommate?

00:15:33.232 --> 00:15:33.532 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
>> Right.

00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:34.133 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
But -- but the deal was

00:15:34.199 --> 00:15:34.733 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
that he paid her back.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.467 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
>> Judge Tanya: Show me evidence

00:15:35.534 --> 00:15:35.934 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
of that deal.

00:15:36.001 --> 00:15:36.802 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
>> Oh, I can't do that.

00:15:36.869 --> 00:15:37.603 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
>> Judge Tanya: She didn't give

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.970 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
the money

00:15:38.037 --> 00:15:39.038 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
to the incarcerated person.

00:15:39.104 --> 00:15:39.672 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
She gave the money

00:15:39.738 --> 00:15:40.873 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
to you, her sister.

00:15:40.939 --> 00:15:41.240 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
>> Right.

00:15:41.307 --> 00:15:41.940 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
>> Judge Tanya: And thus far,

00:15:42.007 --> 00:15:42.341 align:start line:85% position:10% size:15%
ma'am,

00:15:42.408 --> 00:15:43.509 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
I have not heard word one.

00:15:43.575 --> 00:15:44.677 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
I don't understand how you,

00:15:44.743 --> 00:15:45.511 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
in good conscience,

00:15:45.577 --> 00:15:47.112 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
can avoid this obligation.

00:15:47.179 --> 00:15:47.813 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
>> Because I didn't borrow

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:48.614 align:start line:85% position:10% size:25%
the money.

00:15:48.681 --> 00:15:49.381 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
>> Judge Tanya: Judge DiMango?

00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:50.149 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
>> Judge Patricia: You're not

00:15:50.215 --> 00:15:51.350 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
telling the truth.

00:15:51.417 --> 00:15:52.551 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
What was the bail set?

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:53.686 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
>> It was set at 50.

00:15:53.752 --> 00:15:54.887 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
To get him out, it was 5,000.

00:15:54.953 --> 00:15:55.621 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
>> Judge Patricia: It was 5,000.

00:15:55.688 --> 00:15:56.322 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
>> Correct. And then I signed.

00:15:56.388 --> 00:15:56.855 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
>> Judge Patricia:

00:15:56.922 --> 00:15:57.556 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
So what you're telling me

00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:58.324 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
is a person a who's spending

00:15:58.390 --> 00:15:59.124 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
because he doesn't have

00:15:59.191 --> 00:16:00.526 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
a driver's license

00:16:00.592 --> 00:16:01.427 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
gets locked up,

00:16:01.493 --> 00:16:03.896 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
and bail is set at $50,000?

00:16:03.962 --> 00:16:04.863 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
What state do you live in?

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:05.431 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
'Cause I am never

00:16:05.497 --> 00:16:06.365 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
driving through it.

00:16:06.432 --> 00:16:07.333 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
>> It's Oregon.

00:16:07.399 --> 00:16:08.200 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
And it's a felony.

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:09.034 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
>> Judge Patricia: Let's see the

00:16:09.101 --> 00:16:10.469 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
bond receipt that you have

00:16:10.536 --> 00:16:11.537 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
because I don't believe you,

00:16:11.603 --> 00:16:15.641 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
that that's what the charge was.

00:16:15.708 --> 00:16:17.309 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
Premium is 4,000 here,

00:16:17.376 --> 00:16:18.644 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
payment amount, 2,000.

00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:19.611 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
But there's nothing on here

00:16:19.678 --> 00:16:20.179 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
that indicates

00:16:20.245 --> 00:16:21.480 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
what the charges were.

00:16:21.547 --> 00:16:22.781 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
But you bail him out.

00:16:22.848 --> 00:16:23.148 align:start line:85% position:10% size:25%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:16:23.215 --> 00:16:23.882 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
>> Judge Patricia: You say that

00:16:23.949 --> 00:16:24.583 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
there was an agreement

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:25.617 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
you would sell the property.

00:16:25.684 --> 00:16:26.552 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
You have property at his house?

00:16:26.618 --> 00:16:26.952 align:start line:85% position:10% size:28%
>> N -- no.

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:27.753 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
That wasn't the agreement

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.254 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
at first.

00:16:29.321 --> 00:16:29.955 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
The agreement was --

00:16:30.022 --> 00:16:30.689 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
>> Judge Patricia: So where --

00:16:30.756 --> 00:16:31.490 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
>> For him to pay it back.

00:16:31.557 --> 00:16:32.191 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
>> Judge Patricia: But you got

00:16:32.257 --> 00:16:32.691 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
stuck with it.

00:16:32.758 --> 00:16:33.292 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
He stuck you.

00:16:33.359 --> 00:16:33.926 align:start line:85% position:10% size:20%
>> Yeah.

00:16:33.992 --> 00:16:35.127 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
I didn't borrow the money.

00:16:35.194 --> 00:16:37.262 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
>> Judge Patricia: Yes, you did.

00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:37.596 align:start line:85% position:10% size:20%
>> Okay.

00:16:37.663 --> 00:16:38.364 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
>> Judge Patricia: You didn't

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:40.499 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
borrow it for your own use.

00:16:40.566 --> 00:16:41.633 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
But you borrowed it.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.335 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
You're obligated to repay her

00:16:43.402 --> 00:16:44.036 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
whether you use

00:16:44.103 --> 00:16:45.471 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
it personally or not.

00:16:45.537 --> 00:16:45.804 align:start line:85% position:10% size:20%
>> Okay.

00:16:45.871 --> 00:16:46.405 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
>> Judge Patricia: Now,

00:16:46.472 --> 00:16:47.439 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
do you have things in your

00:16:47.506 --> 00:16:48.440 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
home that are his?

00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:48.774 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
>> Yes.

00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:49.541 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
>> Judge Patricia: Sell 'em.

00:16:49.608 --> 00:16:50.476 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
>> That was the plan.

00:16:50.542 --> 00:16:51.110 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
>> Judge Patricia: You --

00:16:51.176 --> 00:16:51.543 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
>> She told me

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:52.411 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
she didn't want me to do that.

00:16:52.478 --> 00:16:53.011 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
She just wanted cash.

00:16:53.078 --> 00:16:53.746 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
>> Judge Patricia: I don't

00:16:53.812 --> 00:16:54.713 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
believe a word that is

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:55.881 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
coming out of those two lips

00:16:55.948 --> 00:16:56.548 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
of yours.

00:16:56.615 --> 00:16:56.882 align:start line:85% position:10% size:20%
Judge --

00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:57.616 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
>> Oh, well. Take it.

00:16:57.683 --> 00:16:58.283 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
>> Judge Patricia: Corriero.

00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:59.718 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
>> Judge Michael: You say this

00:16:59.785 --> 00:17:01.286 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
friend that you bailed out

00:17:01.353 --> 00:17:03.188 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
was a mutual friend

00:17:03.255 --> 00:17:04.590 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
of you and your sister.

00:17:04.656 --> 00:17:05.391 align:start line:85% position:10% size:40%
Is that correct?

00:17:05.457 --> 00:17:06.291 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
>> Right, we both know him.

00:17:06.358 --> 00:17:07.092 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
>> Judge Michael: How long

00:17:07.159 --> 00:17:07.860 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
did you know him?

00:17:07.926 --> 00:17:09.795 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
And how long did she know him?

00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:11.430 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
>> Um, I've known him 15,

00:17:11.497 --> 00:17:12.164 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
20 years.

00:17:12.231 --> 00:17:12.865 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
>> Judge Michael: And his name

00:17:12.931 --> 00:17:13.899 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
is Jacob?

00:17:13.966 --> 00:17:14.299 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
>> Yes.

00:17:14.366 --> 00:17:15.000 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
>> Judge Michael: Do you know

00:17:15.067 --> 00:17:15.300 align:start line:85% position:10% size:15%
Jacob?

00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:15.868 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
>> I know of him.

00:17:15.934 --> 00:17:16.502 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
>> Judge Michael: You have

00:17:16.568 --> 00:17:16.835 align:start line:85% position:10% size:20%
met him?

00:17:16.902 --> 00:17:17.169 align:start line:85% position:10% size:18%
>> Yes.

00:17:17.236 --> 00:17:17.903 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
>> Judge Michael: And under what

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:18.871 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
circumstances did you meet him?

00:17:18.937 --> 00:17:19.838 align:start line:85% position:10% size:30%
>> From her,

00:17:19.905 --> 00:17:21.106 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
when she allowed me.

00:17:21.173 --> 00:17:21.740 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
>> Judge Michael: What do

00:17:21.807 --> 00:17:23.208 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
you mean, when she allowed you?

00:17:23.275 --> 00:17:24.643 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
>> She never let me talk to him.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:25.144 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
>> Judge Michael:

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:25.644 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
What do you mean?

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:26.912 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
She was protective of him or --

00:17:26.979 --> 00:17:28.614 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
>> Or me, some --

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.214 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
>> Judge Michael: Okay.

00:17:29.281 --> 00:17:30.783 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
Now, the question is whether

00:17:30.849 --> 00:17:33.685 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
you vouched for this fellow.

00:17:33.752 --> 00:17:34.920 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
I mean, she wouldn't have

00:17:34.987 --> 00:17:35.587 align:start line:85% position:10% size:23%
given him

00:17:35.654 --> 00:17:37.089 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
the money to get bailed out

00:17:37.156 --> 00:17:38.257 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
if you didn't say,

00:17:38.323 --> 00:17:40.025 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
"He's my guy. Give it to him."

00:17:40.092 --> 00:17:40.492 align:start line:85% position:10% size:28%
Am I right?

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:41.026 align:start line:85% position:10% size:20%
>> Okay.

00:17:41.093 --> 00:17:41.627 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
>> Judge Michael: Well,

00:17:41.693 --> 00:17:43.362 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
that okay is a big okay for me.

00:17:43.429 --> 00:17:45.230 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
Because if you say okay,

00:17:45.297 --> 00:17:46.265 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
then I have to believe that

00:17:46.331 --> 00:17:47.065 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
my colleagues' perception...

00:17:47.132 --> 00:17:47.633 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
>> Where she said --

00:17:47.699 --> 00:17:48.233 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
>> Judge Michael: Is --

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.001 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
is where it should be.

00:17:49.067 --> 00:17:49.668 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
>> That's fine.

00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:50.803 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
She might not have gave me

00:17:50.869 --> 00:17:52.171 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
the money if I went --

00:17:52.237 --> 00:17:53.172 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
if it went to my roommate.

00:17:53.238 --> 00:17:53.472 align:start line:85% position:10% size:15%
Right.

00:17:53.539 --> 00:17:54.173 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
>> Judge Michael: Well, you --

00:17:54.239 --> 00:17:54.807 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
you were vouching for her?

00:17:54.873 --> 00:17:56.275 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
>> Sure. I told her, yes.

00:17:56.341 --> 00:17:56.942 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
>> Judge Michael: All right.

00:17:57.009 --> 00:17:57.976 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
I think I have a better picture

00:17:58.043 --> 00:17:58.710 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
of the situation now.

00:17:58.777 --> 00:17:59.411 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
>> Judge Patricia: We're gonna

00:17:59.478 --> 00:18:00.546 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
retire to deliberate.

00:18:00.612 --> 00:18:03.682 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
Thank you, ladies.

Closed caption is provided by...

00:18:10.122 --> 00:18:11.757 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
>> Announcer: Kathy Martinez

00:18:11.824 --> 00:18:12.558 align:start line:85% position:10% size:28%
has accused

00:18:12.624 --> 00:18:14.660 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
her sister, Loretta Dibble,

00:18:14.726 --> 00:18:16.361 align:start line:85% position:10% size:50%
of owing for a loan.

00:18:16.428 --> 00:18:16.829 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
>> Judge Tanya:

00:18:16.895 --> 00:18:17.729 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
There's no defense here

00:18:17.796 --> 00:18:18.530 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
that I can see.

00:18:18.597 --> 00:18:19.097 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
>> Judge Patricia: No.

00:18:19.164 --> 00:18:19.832 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
>> Judge Michael: Neither do I.

00:18:19.898 --> 00:18:20.365 align:start line:85% position:10% size:48%
I think she vouched

00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:21.166 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
for the loan.

00:18:21.233 --> 00:18:22.501 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
And she's responsible.

00:18:22.568 --> 00:18:23.035 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
>> Judge Patricia:

00:18:23.101 --> 00:18:23.969 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
I don't believe the defendant.

00:18:24.036 --> 00:18:25.037 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
But my real issue here is,

00:18:25.103 --> 00:18:26.738 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
did the plaintiff prove her case

00:18:26.805 --> 00:18:27.439 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
when she said,

00:18:27.506 --> 00:18:28.273 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
"Here's the money.

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:29.475 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
Make sure you pay me back"?

00:18:29.541 --> 00:18:30.876 align:start line:85% position:10% size:78%
I mean, am I missing that there

00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:31.977 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
was an agreement to be repaid?

00:18:32.044 --> 00:18:32.544 align:start line:85% position:10% size:53%
>> Judge Tanya: Yeah.

00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:33.045 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
It was supposed

00:18:33.111 --> 00:18:34.046 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
to be back in two months.

00:18:34.112 --> 00:18:34.780 align:start line:85% position:10% size:80%
And then she gave her more time.

00:18:34.847 --> 00:18:35.714 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
>> Judge Patricia: Yeah, fine.

00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:36.315 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
>> Judge Michael: Right.

00:18:36.381 --> 00:18:36.849 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
>> Judge Patricia:

00:18:36.915 --> 00:18:37.282 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
I'm done then.

00:18:37.349 --> 00:18:39.618 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
>> Judge Tanya: I'm ready.

00:18:39.685 --> 00:18:40.385 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
>> Sonia: Remain seated.

00:18:40.452 --> 00:18:41.019 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
Come to order.

00:18:41.086 --> 00:18:41.854 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
This courtroom is again

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.422 align:start line:85% position:10% size:28%
in session.

00:18:43.489 --> 00:18:44.089 align:start line:85% position:10% size:68%
>> Judge Tanya: Ms. Dibble,

00:18:44.156 --> 00:18:44.656 align:start line:85% position:10% size:40%
it's hard for me

00:18:44.723 --> 00:18:46.191 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
to see you be so cavalier

00:18:46.258 --> 00:18:46.859 align:start line:85% position:10% size:45%
when your sister's

00:18:46.925 --> 00:18:47.726 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
breaking down like that.

00:18:47.793 --> 00:18:48.427 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
>> 'Cause she's lying.

00:18:48.494 --> 00:18:49.194 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
>> Judge Tanya: Uh, say --

00:18:49.261 --> 00:18:49.962 align:start line:85% position:10% size:58%
don't say another word.

00:18:50.028 --> 00:18:50.662 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
>> It's okay. I won't.

00:18:50.729 --> 00:18:51.363 align:start line:85% position:10% size:73%
>> Judge Tanya: Your position

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:52.397 align:start line:85% position:10% size:35%
is outrageous.

00:18:52.464 --> 00:18:53.966 align:start line:85% position:10% size:70%
It is absolutely outrageous.

00:18:54.032 --> 00:18:55.167 align:start line:85% position:10% size:38%
It is shameful.

00:18:55.234 --> 00:18:56.301 align:start line:85% position:10% size:33%
Shame on you.

00:18:56.368 --> 00:18:57.369 align:start line:85% position:10% size:65%
Judgment for the plaintiff

00:18:57.436 --> 00:18:59.037 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
in the amount of $2,700.

00:18:59.104 --> 00:19:00.939 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
Good luck to you, ma'am.

00:19:01.006 --> 00:19:01.540 align:start line:85% position:10% size:60%
>> Sonia: This courtroom

00:19:01.607 --> 00:19:03.542 align:start line:85% position:10% size:43%
is now in recess.

00:19:03.609 --> 00:19:04.543 align:start line:85% position:10% size:63%
>> Announcer: "Hot Bench"

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:07.045 align:start line:85% position:10% size:55%
continues in a moment.

00:19:07.112 --> 00:19:10.015 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
And on the next "Hot Bench"...

00:19:13.185 --> 00:19:14.620 align:start line:10% position:10% size:63%
>> It's been over a year.

00:19:14.686 --> 00:19:15.587 align:start line:10% position:10% size:60%
I haven't talked to her.

00:19:15.654 --> 00:19:16.788 align:start line:10% position:10% size:50%
So maybe just seeing

00:19:16.855 --> 00:19:19.558 align:start line:10% position:10% size:55%
her makes me cr-- sad.

00:19:19.625 --> 00:19:21.426 align:start line:10% position:10% size:23%
>> Drama.

00:19:21.493 --> 00:19:22.494 align:start line:10% position:10% size:63%
>> 'Cause it's my sister.

00:19:22.561 --> 00:19:24.096 align:start line:10% position:10% size:33%
And I just...

00:19:24.162 --> 00:19:24.897 align:start line:10% position:10% size:30%
It hurts me.

00:19:24.963 --> 00:19:26.565 align:start line:10% position:10% size:40%
>> She's faking.
