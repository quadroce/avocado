ALEX PAEN: IT'S TIME TO "GET WILD" AT THE SAN DIEGO ZOO. WILD" AT THE SAN DIEGO ZOO.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.960 line:82%
WILD" AT THE SAN DIEGO ZOO.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.800 line:82%
NARRATOR: IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.720 line:82%
ONE SPECIES STANDS HEAD AND

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.600 line:82%
SHOULDERS ABOVE THE REST--

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.920 line:82%
THE GIRAFFE! GIRAFFES ARE THE

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.600 line:82%
TALLEST LAND MAMMALS IN THE

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.800 line:82%
WORLD. HOW TALL ARE THEY?

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.560 line:82%
THE AVERAGE MALE GIRAFFE STANDS

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.040 line:82%
18 FEET TALL, AND FEMALES ARE

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.720 line:82%
ABOUT 14 FEET TALL. THEY LIVE ON

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.800 line:82%
SAVANNAS IN AFRICA, WHERE THEY

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.800 line:82%
EAT THE LEAVES OF ACACIA TREES,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.080 line:82%
WHICH GROW VERY TALL. BUT THAT'S

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.800 line:82%
NO PROBLEM FOR A GIRAFFE.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.560 line:82%
CAN YOU GUESS WHY?

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.760 line:82%
THAT'S RIGHT! THEIR LOOONG

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.480 line:82%
NECKS. A GIRAFFE'S NECK IS ABOUT

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.000 line:82%
6 FEET LONG. THAT'S THE SIZE OF

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.000 line:82%
A TALL HUMAN.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.560 line:82%
EVEN THOUGH THEY LOOK SIMILAR,

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.000 line:82%
THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.440 line:82%
GIRAFFES. ONE WAY TO TELL THEM

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.160 line:82%
APART IS TO LOOK AT THE SPACES

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.600 line:82%
BETWEEN THEIR SPOTS.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.880 line:82%
A RETICULATED GIRAFFE HAS

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.640 line:82%
SKINNIER SPACES THAN

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.720 line:82%
A ROTHSCHILD'S GIRAFFE.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.080 line:82%
THE DIFFERENCE RUNS DOWN THEIR

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.600 line:82%
LEGS, TOO. THE SPLOTCHY PATTERN

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.320 line:82%
GOES TO THE TOES ON A

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.560 line:82%
RETICULATED GIRAFFE BUT NOT ON

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.920 line:82%
OF A ROTHSCHILD'S. AT THE VERY

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.440 line:82%
TOP OF A GIRAFFE IS ONE OF THEIR

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.360 line:82%
BEST-KNOWN CHARACTERISTICS--

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.840 line:82%
THEIR OSSICONES. OSSICONES ARE

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.880 line:82%
HORNLIKE GROWTHS, AND ONLY

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.360 line:82%
GIRAFFES AND OKAPIS HAVE THEM.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.800 line:82%
AS GIRAFFES WALK, INSECTS FLY

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.560 line:82%
AND JUMP OUT OF THEIR WAY,

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.440 line:82%
MAKING IT EASIER FOR BIRDS TO

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.440 line:82%
SWOOP IN AND GRAB A QUICK

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.600 line:82%
MEAL. GIRAFFES ARE AMAZING

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.120 line:82%
ANIMALS, WITH INTERESTING

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.560 line:82%
CHARACTERISTICS AND BEHAVIORS.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.280 line:82%
AND THAT'S THE LONG AND SHORT

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.680 line:82%
OF IT.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.400 line:82%
PETE: TODAY WE ARE HERE AT THE

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.320 line:82%
STONE ZOO IN STONEHAM,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.680 line:82%
MASSACHUSETTS, JUST OUTSIDE OF

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.320 line:82%
BOSTON. AND WE'RE HERE TO TALK

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.400 line:82%
ABOUT GIBBONS.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.920 line:82%
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.840 line:82%
GIBBONS GET ENRICHMENT EVERY

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.440 line:82%
DAY.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.480 line:82%
THIS MORNING WE USED A COUPLE

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.600 line:82%
DIFFERENT FEEDERS THAT WE USE.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.120 line:82%
WE HAVE SMALL PUZZLE FEEDERS

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.200 line:82%
THAT WE CAN PUT THINGS LIKE

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.600 line:82%
GRAPES, RAISINS,

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.800 line:82%
SMALL PIECES OF FRUIT IN.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.760 line:82%
OTHER TIMES I DROP IT.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.480 line:82%
HERE WE GO.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.480 line:82%
AND THE GIBBONS HAVE TO ACTUALLY

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.480 line:82%
WORK AT GETTING THE FOOD OUT.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.000 line:82%
SO HERE AT STONE ZOO, RIGHT NOW

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.920 line:82%
WE HAVE 4 GIBBONS. WE HAVE OUR

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.080 line:82%
PAIR, OF WHICH KIEN IS THE DAD,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.800 line:82%
AND THEN TWO OFFSPRING. ONE IS

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.560 line:82%
4 YEARS OLD, AND THE OTHER ONE

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.800 line:82%
IS NOW 11 MONTHS OLD.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.560 line:82%
GIBBONS LIVE IN FAMILY TROOPS,

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.000 line:82%
SO IT'S BASICALLY YOU HAVE MOM

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.160 line:82%
AND DAD AND THEIR OFFSPRING.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.320 line:82%
THE OFFSPRING WILL STAY WITH MOM

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.880 line:82%
AND DAD FOR SOMETIMES 8 TO 10

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.880 line:82%
YEARS, AND IN THAT TIME THEY'RE

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.800 line:82%
GONNA LEARN HOW TO BE A GIBBON

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.000 line:82%
FROM THEIR PARENTS AND FROM

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.360 line:82%
THEIR SIBLINGS.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.320 line:82%
SO KIEN IS OUR MALE GIBBON. HE

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.680 line:82%
IS NOW 14 YEARS OLD. WHAT MAKES

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.200 line:82%
KIEN UNIQUE IS THAT HE'S MISSING

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.800 line:82%
HIS RIGHT ARM JUST BELOW THE

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.720 line:82%
ELBOW. KIEN HAD A TERRIBLE

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.160 line:82%
ACCIDENT AND ENDED UP LOSING THE

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.840 line:82%
ARM, BUT AS YOU CAN SEE, HE'S

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.000 line:82%
ADAPTED FINE TO LIFE WITHOUT HIS

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.120 line:82%
ARM.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.800 line:82%
WHEN WE GOT KIEN AND WE

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.320 line:82%
INTRODUCED HIM TO THE EXHIBIT,

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.480 line:82%
INTRODUCED HIM TO HIS MATE, WE

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.840 line:82%
REALIZED PRETTY QUICKLY THAT

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.040 line:82%
HE'D HAVE NO PROBLEM GETTING

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.600 line:82%
AROUND IN THE EXHIBIT. KIEN IS

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.360 line:82%
REALLY A CHARACTER. IF YOU WATCH

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.200 line:82%
HIM IN THE EXHIBIT, HE'S NOT

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.640 line:82%
GOING TO IMMEDIATELY RUN OUT AND

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.200 line:82%
GRAB THE BEST TREATS ON EXHIBIT.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.040 line:82%
HE'S GOING TO KIND OF THINK

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.200 line:82%
HIS WAY THROUGH IT. HE'S GONNA

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.680 line:82%
WATCH THE REST OF THE TROOP,

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.560 line:82%
AND ESPECIALLY IGGY WHO HAS THE

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.960 line:82%
BABY RIGHT NOW. SHE'S KIND OF

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.600 line:82%
RUNNING THE TROOP. SO KIEN

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.560 line:82%
WILL KIND OF WAIT, SEE WHERE

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.760 line:82%
EVERYBODY ELSE GOES, AND THEN

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.800 line:82%
HE'LL METHODICALLY GO THROUGH

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:20.960 line:82%
THE EXHIBIT, PICKING OUT

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.320 line:82%
THE FOOD. AND THE INTERESTING

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.200 line:82%
THING IS, THE KEEPERS SPEND A

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.600 line:82%
LOT OF TIME HIDING THE GOOD

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.280 line:82%
STUFF, SO KIEN USUALLY GETS THE

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.280 line:82%
GOOD STUFF 'CAUSE HE'S PATIENT.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.960 line:82%
HE WILL USE HIS FEET TO KIND OF

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.520 line:82%
MAKE UP FOR ONLY HAVING ONE HAND

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.600 line:82%
WHEN HE'S JUMPING THROUGH THE

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.920 line:82%
EXHIBIT AND STUFF. HE WILL

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.480 line:82%
ACTUALLY WALK ON A TIGHTROPE

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.880 line:82%
ACROSS SOME OF THE ROPES IN THE

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.040 line:82%
EXHIBIT. THAT'S SOMETHING THE

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.800 line:82%
OTHER GIBBONS DON'T DO, WHICH IS

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.400 line:82%
REALLY INTERESTING. I THINK ONE

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.800 line:82%
OF MY FAVORITE THINGS WITH KIEN

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.520 line:82%
IS JUST, YOU CAN ALWAYS SEE HIM

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.040 line:82%
THINKING, AND ESPECIALLY WHEN WE

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.400 line:82%
FIRST PUT THEM OUT THIS MORNING,

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.680 line:82%
IS EVERYBODY RAN OUT AND DID

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.000 line:82%
THEIR THING, AND HE SAW--HE

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.560 line:82%
KIND OF HUNG BACK. HE LOOKED

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.480 line:82%
AROUND. HE'S REALLY SMART AND HE

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.160 line:82%
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO TO GET

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.880 line:82%
THE BEST TREATS THROUGHOUT

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.680 line:82%
THE DAY.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.840 line:82%
IT'S GREAT TO SEE AN ANIMAL

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.840 line:82%
THAT'S OVERCOME ALL THE

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.280 line:82%
OBSTACLES IN HIS LIFE AND IS

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.200 line:82%

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.760 line:82%

THE NURSERY TO VISIT HER FAMILY.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.440 line:82%
SHE'S DOING VERY WELL. THIS IS

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.920 line:82%
SORT OF UNCHARTED TERRITORY FOR

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.840 line:82%
US, BECAUSE AS FAR AS WE KNOW,

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.000 line:82%
THIS IS THE ONLY SILVER-LEAF

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.560 line:82%

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.960 line:82%
WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT TO EXPECT,

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.160 line:82%
BUT SO FAR SHE'S DOING VERY

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.440 line:82%

THE BABIES BACK INTO THEIR NATAL

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.480 line:82%
GROUPS OR FAMILY GROUPS AS SOON

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.040 line:82%

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.400 line:82%
ARE SORT OF INTERESTING,

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.320 line:82%
ESPECIALLY THE BABIES, BECAUSE

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.560 line:82%
THEY HAVE WHAT'S CALLED A NATAL

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.440 line:82%
COAT. AND THE ADULT ANIMALS ARE

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.440 line:82%
ACTUALLY A BEAUTIFUL SILVER-GRAY

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.040 line:82%
COLOR, COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.760 line:82%
THE BABY THAT YOU SEE. THE

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.280 line:82%
BABY'S COAT WILL CHANGE

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.840 line:82%
GRADUALLY OVER TIME. SHE'LL GET

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.040 line:82%
MORE AND MORE OF THE SILVER AND

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.040 line:82%
LOSE MORE AND MORE OF THAT

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.600 line:82%
BRIGHT-ORANGE COLOR.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.280 line:82%
JEFF: HERE AT THE SAN DIEGO ZOO

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.000 line:82%
INSTITUTE FOR CONSERVATION

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.960 line:82%
RESEARCH, WE'VE JUST HATCHED 9

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.200 line:82%
CRITICALLY ENDANGERED GRAND

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.120 line:82%
CAYMAN BLUE IGUANAS. AND THESE

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.680 line:82%
HAVE HATCHED IN OUR SPECIALTY

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.880 line:82%
CENTER, OUR KENNETH C. AND

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.600 line:82%
ANNE D. GRIFFIN REPTILE

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.240 line:82%
CONSERVATION CENTER. THE GRAND

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.040 line:82%
CAYMAN BLUE IGUANA IS CRITICALLY

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.000 line:82%
ENDANGERED. IT'S ONE OF THE MOST

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.640 line:82%
ENDANGERED REPTILES IN THE

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.240 line:82%
WORLD. AND WE HAVE TWO BREEDING

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.840 line:82%
PAIRS HERE AT THE GRIFFIN

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.440 line:82%
CENTER, AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.880 line:82%
THAT WE BREED THESE ANIMALS.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:26.880 line:82%
IN THE WILD THEY'RE VERY

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.840 line:82%
ENDANGERED, AND IF SOMETHING

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.520 line:82%
SUCH AS A HURRICANE OR OTHER

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.880 line:82%
CATASTROPHE HAPPENS, IT COULD

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.400 line:82%
WIPE OUT THE ENTIRE IGUANA

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.960 line:82%
POPULATION. SO HERE AT THE

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.320 line:82%
CENTER AND IN OTHER ZOOS ACROSS

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.360 line:82%
NORTH AMERICA, WE KEEP CAPTIVE

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.080 line:82%
ANIMALS THAT HAVE THE SAME

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.520 line:82%
GENETICS AS THE WILD ANIMALS.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.200 line:82%
SO WE BREED THESE AND WE KEEP

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.640 line:82%
THEM AMONGST ALL THE ZOOS IN

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.160 line:82%
CASE SOMETHING HAPPENS, THEN WE

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.440 line:82%
CAN PUT THEM BACK IN GRAND

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.160 line:82%
CAYMAN IF NEED BE. OUR ADULT

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.280 line:82%
ANIMALS WERE HATCHED IN GRAND

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.600 line:82%
CAYMAN, AND THEY WERE BROUGHT TO

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.920 line:82%
US AS JUVENILES WHEN THEY WERE

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.440 line:82%
ABOUT TWO YEARS OLD. AND THE

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.040 line:82%
NEXT YEAR THEY STARTED LAYING

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.680 line:82%
EGGS. AND THOSE HATCH AT ABOUT

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.360 line:82%
100 DAYS, AND ONCE THEY HATCH,

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.640 line:82%
WE RAISE THEM UP. THEY START

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.680 line:82%
EATING THEIR GREENS AND

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.960 line:82%
EVERYTHING THEY LIKE TO EAT.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.440 line:82%
THEN WE SEE WHICH ZOOS REALLY

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.400 line:82%
NEED ANIMALS FOR DISPLAY OR FOR

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.600 line:82%
THE BREEDING PROGRAM, AND THEY

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.320 line:82%
GET SENT TO OTHER ZOOS. NOW,

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.440 line:82%
THESE ARE CALLED GRAND CAYMAN

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.840 line:82%
BLUE IGUANAS BECAUSE AS THEY'RE

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.360 line:82%
OLDER, THEY BECOME BLUE. WHEN

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.640 line:82%
THEY HATCH, THEY'RE KIND OF GRAY

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.840 line:82%
WITH STRIPES, AND AS THEY AGE

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.200 line:82%
THEY GET MORE AND MORE BLUE.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.080 line:82%
EVEN OUR ADULTS WHICH AREN'T

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.120 line:82%
FULLY GROWN YET ONLY ARE BLUE

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.200 line:82%
KIND OF IN THE FACE AND ON THE

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.240 line:82%
BACK, BUT WHEN THEY'RE REALLY

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.040 line:82%
LARGE 3- TO 4-FOOT IGUANAS,

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:28.800 line:82%
THEY'LL BE COMPLETELY

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.200 line:82%
POWDER-BLUE.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.000 line:82%
JOSH: HEY, EVERYBODY, DO YOU

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.240 line:82%
WANT TO TALK ABOUT A REALLY COOL

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.360 line:82%
TORTOISE THAT LIVES ON AN

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.880 line:82%
ISLAND? I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.600 line:82%
THIS BIG GIRL BACK HERE. I'M

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.360 line:82%
TALKING ABOUT THIS LITTLE ONE.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.640 line:82%
SO THIS LITTLE GUY RIGHT HERE,

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.440 line:82%
HE'S CALLED A SPIDER TORTOISE,

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.600 line:82%
AND THEY'RE FROM THE ISLAND OF

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.400 line:82%
MADAGASCAR. AND THEY'RE CALLED

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.000 line:82%
SPIDER TORTOISES--HE MAY NOT

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.560 line:82%
LOOK LIKE IT NOW, BUT WHEN

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.720 line:82%
THEY'RE ADULTS, THEIR SHELLS

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.240 line:82%
RESEMBLE A SPIDER WEB. AND

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.920 line:82%
THAT'S HOW THEY GOT THEIR NAME.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.640 line:82%
SO AS YOU CAN SEE, THIS GUY'S

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.800 line:82%
PRETTY SMALL. HE FITS IN THE

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.240 line:82%
PALM OF MY HAND. BUT LIKE I

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.680 line:82%
SAID, HE'S JUST A HATCHLING.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:24.800 line:82%
SO THE ADULTS WILL ACTUALLY GET

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.440 line:82%
ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BAKED

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.520 line:82%
POTATO. SO THAT'S ABOUT 6-8

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.440 line:82%
INCHES LONG.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.240 line:82%
SO IN THE WILD THESE GUYS ARE

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.160 line:82%
MAINLY GRAZERS, GRAZING ON DRY

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.440 line:82%
GRASSES AND OCCASIONALLY MAYBE

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.040 line:82%
SOME CACTUS. BUT HERE AT THE ZOO

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.080 line:82%
THEY GET A WIDE VARIETY OF FOODS

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.400 line:82%
RANGING FROM ALL KINDS OF

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.920 line:82%
PRODUCE, LIKE ROMAINE AND

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.680 line:82%
DANDELION GREENS, AND

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.840 line:82%
OCCASIONALLY THEY'LL GET SOME

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.040 line:82%
FRUITS, TOO, LIKE BERRIES OR

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.680 line:82%
STRAWBERRIES.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.000 line:82%
SO THESE GUYS ARE CRITICALLY

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.720 line:82%
ENDANGERED, AND ON TOP OF THAT,

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.000 line:82%
THEY ONLY LAY ONE EGG AT A TIME,

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.800 line:82%
AND IT TAKES 6 WHOLE MONTHS FOR

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.560 line:82%
THESE GUYS TO INCUBATE. AND HERE

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.880 line:82%
AT HOGLE ZOO WE DO HAVE ONE

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.200 line:82%
BREEDING PAIR OF SPIDER

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.880 line:82%
TORTOISES, AND WE HOPE TO

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.400 line:82%
INCREASE THE POPULATION. I THINK

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.400 line:82%
THEY'RE UP FOR THE CHALLENGE,

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.320 line:82%
AND SO ARE WE.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.240 line:82%
ALEX: WELCOME BACK TO "GET WILD"

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.520 line:82%

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.840 line:82%
MELODI: WE'RE HERE AT THE SAN

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.640 line:82%

5-WEEK-OLD GREATER ONE-HORNED

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.920 line:82%
RHINOCEROS CALF.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.560 line:82%
HER NAME IS SHOMILI, AND HER MOM

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.840 line:82%
IS FEEDING HER AND TAKING CARE

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.800 line:82%
OF HER. WE'RE JUST OFFERING A

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.240 line:82%
COUPLE OF SUPPLEMENT BOTTLES TO

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.440 line:82%
MAKE SURE THAT SHE CONTINUES TO

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.360 line:82%
GROW AS SHE SHOULD.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.760 line:82%
WE GAVE MILI A LITTLE BIT OF A

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.680 line:82%
MUDBATH TODAY. WE GOT SOME NICE

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.280 line:82%
WARM MUD AND JUST SPREAD IT ALL

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.560 line:82%
OVER HER BODY, SO SHE'S A LITTLE

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.200 line:82%
BIT OF A BROWN RHINO RIGHT NOW.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.520 line:82%
BUT MUD IS A NATURAL SUNSCREEN

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.440 line:82%
FOR ANIMALS. AND SINCE SHE'S

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.040 line:82%
GOING OUT INTO THE YARD WITH

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.200 line:82%
HER MOTHER AND SHE'S SEEING A

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.840 line:82%
LOT OF SUN RIGHT NOW, THANK

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.400 line:82%
GOODNESS, THEN WE'RE GIVING HER

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.320 line:82%
THAT REAL THICK SUNSCREEN TO

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.200 line:82%
HELP PROTECT HER SKIN. IT ALSO

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.280 line:82%
HELPS TO MOISTURIZE IT A LITTLE

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.480 line:82%
BIT. MUD'S GOOD FOR THAT.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.200 line:82%
SHE WATCHES MOM AND SHE DOES

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.840 line:82%
WHAT MOM DOES AND EATS WHAT MOM

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.440 line:82%
EATS. THE HOPE IS THAT MOM CAN

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.480 line:82%
COMPLETELY TAKE OVER IN THE

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.480 line:82%
FUTURE. IF NOT, WE'RE PREPARED

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.920 line:82%
WITH BOTTLES AT THE READY, SO

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.920 line:82%
WE'LL JUST KEEP SUPPLEMENTING AS

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.240 line:82%
CURTIS: AT 3:39 A.M. THIS

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.600 line:82%
MORNING HERE AT THE SAN DIEGO

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.400 line:82%
ZOO SAFARI PARK, WE HAD A BABY

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.320 line:82%
ELEPHANT BORN. THIS IS SWAZI'S

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.840 line:82%
SECOND CALF. SHE'S A GIRL, AND

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.720 line:82%
NOW WE HAVE 13 AFRICAN

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.160 line:82%
ELEPHANTS. LIKE MOST OF OUR

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.080 line:82%
CALVES, THE BABY GOT UP RATHER

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.320 line:82%
QUICKLY, WITHIN MINUTES OF BEING

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.960 line:82%
BORN. AND SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.440 line:82%
FOR NOW AND THE MILESTONE THAT

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.320 line:82%
THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS FOR IS

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.040 line:82%
FOR HER TO NURSE SUCCESSFULLY

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.560 line:82%
OFF THE MOM. IT'S ALL

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.880 line:82%
INSTINCTUAL, BUT SHE HAS TO

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.040 line:82%
FIGURE OUT WHERE THE NIPPLE IS

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.640 line:82%
ON HER OWN. MOM HELPS HER OUT AS

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.840 line:82%
SHE CAN, BUT IT'S STILL UP TO

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.080 line:82%
THE BABY. SHE'S GOTTEN REAL

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.240 line:82%
CLOSE AND WE CAN HEAR THE

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.640 line:82%
SUCTION ALL OVER MOM'S BODY,
